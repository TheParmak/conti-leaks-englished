I've done much better than that. Captcha won't be taken into account yet, we'll consider it. Proxy is a weak option, it will be nordvpn or amazon lambda (like in cart) in the docker. SMTP will be considered. Profile creation will be considered. Mailing is done via GET requests for quick sending of big volumes of 100,000,000, 200,000,000 e-mails. This is a childish variant - any mail server will kill such activity immediately. This article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ describes a working variant - you will need to create thousands of such dockers and send just 10 emails from each mail account, sent by an AI emulator that imitates mouse movements, similar to human ones. Every mailer now has an AI, it recognizes all browser movements and their AI will just laugh out loud over gettests to send hundreds of thousands of emails.\n8. The cookie authorization thing without a password is right, I noticed it long ago when working with stylers, you load cookies and just log into your account.\n\n9. We have 1000 accounts and 100 proxies, and these 1000 accounts will be assigned randomly to these 100 proxies with repetition, if there are more proxies, then 1 acre 1 proxy.\n===In case of change of IP in the ak immediately will cause logging problems, it is better to abandon this option, the ideal option - docker with VPN.\n10 Generating PDF files with macros + with wkhtmltopdf===there is no need to do that, the applet can do that from the very birth\n everything else seems fine\n{tz - practically new, very many additions, accepted for execution.

I've done much better than that. Captcha won't be taken into account yet, we'll consider it. Proxy is a weak option, it will be nordvpn or amazon lambda (like in cart) in the docker. SMTP will be considered. Profile creation will be considered. Mailing is done via GET requests for quick sending of big volumes of 100,000,000, 200,000,000 e-mails. This is a childish variant - any mail server will kill such activity immediately. This article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ describes a working variant - you will need to create thousands of such dockers and send just 10 emails from each mail account, sent by an AI emulator that imitates mouse movements, similar to human ones. Every mailer now has an AI, it recognizes all browser movements and their AI will just laugh out loud over gettests to send hundreds of thousands of emails.\n8. The cookie authorization thing without a password is right, I noticed it long ago when working with stylers, you load cookies and just log in to your account.\n\n9. We have 1000 accounts and 100 proxies, and these 1000 accounts will be assigned randomly to these 100 proxies with repetition, if there are more proxies, then 1 acre 1 proxy.\n===In case of change of IP in the ak immediately will cause logging problems, it is better to abandon this option, the ideal option - docker with VPN.\n10 Generating PDF files with macros + with wkhtmltopdf===there is no need to do that, the applet can do that from the very birth\n everything else seems fine\n{tz - practically new, very many additions, accepted for execution.
