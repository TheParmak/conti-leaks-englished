You still haven't answered what kind of configuration you need for the installs. Remind that we decided to give it the version of Trick2 (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - what modules should be in the configure of Trick, and which can be removed in order not to stain unnecessary modules and reduce weight of the exe. If I understand the structure of the software correctly - I need injector, pvgrub, importdll. What other modules are vital in the configuration? {backslash}n{backslash}n4. I've contacted hors about admins - he clarified the problem, he says we need more pentesters, not admins. And at 6 am in my beautiful and drunken head came up with a great idea where to get them :) Remember Revils PR'd on Damag - a thousand bucks in bitcoins on the deposit and then they started tearing up the topic - they wrote there that they are inviting teams of hackers / pentester to work with them. They wrote five pages of their topic with offers! They wrote something like. {backslash}"Team 3 people experience, etc." and there are a lot of them 5 or more pages! That's where we'll get them! I spammed on them all personalities with an offer of work + many there are contacts left (though toks all). By the 10 th will be done. The only question is about payment to them. How much do we pay? 2k - as all? {{backslash}n{backslash}n6p and zn me if you can))) bc1qclzlkqq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf"

So that if the file gets tired quickly (and we have it is not uncommon + its volume) - we always have a ready crypted second file in order to avoid downtime and waiting for cryptors. I think it would be a good move, just remembering times when I myself poured - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delays) and the second point - the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours. And with this maneuver we have a good reassurance."
