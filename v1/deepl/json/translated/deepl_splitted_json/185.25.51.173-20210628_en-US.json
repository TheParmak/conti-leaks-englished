There starts the bullshit that they themselves do not understand who they pay who do not ... I wrote to Prof. Maybe you and C clarify who ends up paying who, etc.. He said ok and silence. Just in all our chats have people who pay us and the prof, even the reverses. I propose that there was no confusion and no one there accidentally by 2 times did not stick (was last time a couple of attempts, but I prieketsya))) - We need to decide Either I pay all the wages, or let the chat with pentesters where prof - they themselves pay all.

If the company doesn't contact - its data will be transferred further to the website and published (for this you need to pull up either the solver or some of his support team in this chat) The problem with calls is that most often the calls get to the reception, where there is some lady who does not know the situation.

  "body": "About the profile - I talked to him, he said that you will decide everything on your own and tell me what to do, neither from you nor from him in the end there was no information... {backslash}I am trying to work for all your wishes, and you read through a line like everything ... I even just sent you this guy git @ I wrote that he has a development on the social network, on the bitcoin mixer, and you with him for the blockchain in the end talked. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - so he has them. I don't know about the blockchain part - we'll search for other people for it... so you're either talking to him for the wrong reasons or I don't understand correctly the tasks you're setting{nInspecting here day and night on all fronts that you set, I want you to be satisfied with everything there, I always show some initiative, but you answer once a day at best... {backslash}As for pulling someone close to you - well yes I did, through my brother found the right people to solve your problem. No one will do that for you online. And offline, I do not think that you'll find the same badass guys who will agree to risk a normal white firm with a hefty turnover and reputation, and even more than one at the end... To buy this carbon was a matter of principle already, and I could not find any other options with whom it could be done, and no one else would have found it, this is not a coke on the hydra to buy there own security service works like in the white house. It was just such a fucking difficult task, and in the end we got it done, we bought it. I also promised the guys that I would give them chicks and a sauna, because it was really not that easy. The same thing about Alka - you set the task to solve her problem. I'm working my butt off to solve it, thanks to the fact that I have good opportunities in this area - but then again, it's all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. And I understand my personal risks as well. But I'm doing your request as for me. In general, all these very extravagant quests you try to solve. I worry about the results of the whole team as for my own. I get upset when negative things come flying at you and try to fix it all, fix it all up. I save your money as my own, I demand reports from everyone, bargain with everyone, collect sanctions if anyone has them... For all financial matters, everything is always clear and a few times I write you back, that where and how much was spent, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in this at all. I am not a psychic. I can't think for you about your cunning plan and all your desires. Then write down your tasks more precisely. I wrote about off-line, that I'll do through friends - all the time I wrote it. You didn't say a word. And now you say that you can not. We also talked about the budget of all these moves more than once - you wrote that OK, 50 60k is fine for you... And then it turns out that you don't even need it anymore.  I wrote that we have people who we have not considered before - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide myself with them so as not to bother you and not to ask for another 3-5k, you all write off and describe, where and what was spent - and you do not even remember about it. {backslash}You keep telling me that you're not interested in what's going on here, that no matter how hard I've worked for you, that I'm bringing you results, and you won't even remember it in two days. {backslash}"Later, tomorrow, yeah, OK" It's all a small thing to you, but I've lived my whole life here while I've organized and set it up. I'll be gray in a year."

  "body": "About the profile - I talked to him, he said that you will decide everything on your own and tell me what to do, neither from you nor from him in the end there was no information... {backslash}I am trying to work for all your wishes, and you read through a line like everything ... I even just sent you this guy git @ I wrote that he has a development on the social network, on the bitcoin mixer, and you with him for the blockchain in the end talked. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - so he has them. I don't know about the blockchain part - we'll search for other people for it... so you're either talking to him for the wrong reasons or I don't understand correctly the tasks you're setting{nInspecting here day and night on all fronts that you set, I want you to be satisfied with everything there, I always show some initiative, but you answer once a day at best... {backslash}As for pulling someone close to you - well yes I did, through my brother found the right people to solve your problem. No one will do that for you online. And offline, I do not think that you'll find the same badass guys who will agree to risk a normal white firm with a hefty turnover and reputation, and even more than one at the end... To buy this carbon was a matter of principle already, and I could not find any other options with whom it could be done, and no one else would have found it, this is not a coke on the hydra to buy there own security service works like in the white house. It was just such a fucking difficult task, and in the end we got it done, we bought it. I also promised the guys that I would give them chicks and a sauna, because it was really not that easy. The same thing about Alka - you set the task to solve her problem. I'm working my butt off to solve it, thanks to the fact that I have good opportunities in this area - but then again, it's all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. And I understand my personal risks as well. But I'm doing your request as for me. In general, all these very extravagant quests you try to solve. I worry about the results of the whole team as for my own. I get upset when negative things come flying at you and try to fix it all, fix it all up. I save your money as my own, I demand reports from everyone, bargain with everyone, collect sanctions if anyone has them... For all financial matters, everything is always clear and a few times I write you back, that where and how much was spent, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in this at all. I am not a psychic. I can't think for you about your cunning plan and all your desires. Then write down your tasks more precisely. I wrote about off-line, that I'll do through friends - all the time I wrote it. You didn't say a word. And now you say that you can not. We also talked about the budget of all these moves more than once - you wrote that OK, 50 60k is fine for you... And then it turns out that you don't even need it anymore.  I wrote that we have people who we have not considered before - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide myself with them so as not to bother you and not to ask for another 3-5k, you all write off and describe, where and what was spent - and you do not even remember about it. {backslash}You keep telling me that you're not interested in what's going on here, that no matter how hard I've worked for you, that I'm bringing you results, and you won't even remember it in two days. {backslash}"Later, tomorrow, yeah, OK" It's all a small thing to you, but I've lived my whole life here while I've organized and set it up. I'll be gray in a year."
