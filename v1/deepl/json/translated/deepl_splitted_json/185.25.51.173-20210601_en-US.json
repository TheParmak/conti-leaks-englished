  "body": "We've been discussing the subject of ransom payments with Horse too, I understand they all pay very reluctantly, we must put more pressure... On the timing of limiting dunno how, of course, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, because many take loans, etc.. I think that it is necessary to analyze the deeper and creeping it is that we leak that is expensive for them, but not everything, plus we must be harder to pressure, annoying phone calls, pester partners, cover in the media... I propose to organize the work so that by the time the local have a full report on the analysis: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we find partners, their contacts, and most importantly calculated strategy, how to pressure that for which targets is acceptable. We are tits up, bargaining like schoolboys, gangsters do not behave that way, all these concessions are useless, I did not even expect it from you :-D We just have to be realistic at first to put the price and stand firm on its own. And we start with a lakh and agree to 100k. Given the fact that the FBI is monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are making fun of us. There's a reason they're pulling all these negotiations, studying us, our wallets, etc... And if they are so damn relaxed and do not want to pay - let's have some kind of violent protest. Maybe a big plum what a loud, or even something that will attract attention, maybe even make lokov and plums without any redemption - a show flogging type) Discount there companies 30-50-100 - throw out all the data, who can break ... you can not even the big, but so that everyone was on the ear, so that others have strained and thought less ... And change the color of the admin panel, we're locker, not Tiffany's :-D
