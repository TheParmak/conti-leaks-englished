I have several pentester teams, several stand-alone pentesters, and my taggers, of all kinds. I only need a locker, but actually 30% would not work for me. Because the big teams I had were working for a lower percentage, and I still have to earn something from administration. Your locker was in my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it is not bad, so I wrote. If you have a more interesting offer for the %, I am ready to consider. {backslash}I've got all the reports on modules and bugs in trike, so far the main problem is with importdll and superbrowser, everything else works fine, everything was cleaned up and updated. I don't know about the vnts yet, but it's in the process.
