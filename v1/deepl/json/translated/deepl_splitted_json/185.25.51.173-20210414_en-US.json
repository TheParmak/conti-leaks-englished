We are still just trying to figure out how much we can scrape together to offer. While we are doing that, my boss wanted me to ask you whether or not we will get access to our data that you took once we paid anything? We have understandably done some research and we have seen that in some cases, the data is given back to people once a payment has been made. We also noticed in the file tree that you sent over that some of the file paths look like they were from your local system. We would also like assurances that our data has been deleted from local systems as well"
