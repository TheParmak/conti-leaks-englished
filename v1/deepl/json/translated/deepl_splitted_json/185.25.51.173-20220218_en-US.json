I understand the principle, that's roughly what I imagined.\nIt's written in C++, works only on Linux, of course.\n2. There is also Exonum. It's an open source framework for building blockchain based applications. \Exonum is a system where only a predefined group of nodes (validators) can create new blocks in the blockchain. This one is written in Rust. I looked at their Github. You can see they're maintaining it, there were some changes a month ago. It's not abandoned. We have to do something. I feel like a slacker. I'm trying to do a p2p network in Rust. I'm figuring it out and I've already started writing code. But Exonum is something to keep an eye on."
