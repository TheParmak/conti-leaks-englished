They generally manage, there are a lot of loads going through, may take longer to clean. I gave the stubs to Bentley, he did crypts through them for a while, said they worked well, now, I will add these stubs to the panel, will be on their profile type for all loads. I'm going to make a slope on the profile under the trike, since they didn't notice that profile. This will reduce the load on the other profiles and speed up the issuance of crypto files."
