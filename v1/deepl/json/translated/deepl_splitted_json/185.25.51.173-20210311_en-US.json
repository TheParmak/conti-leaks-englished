Your job and others who are involved, to give me access, code, servers and everything I need to work efficiently, I don't think it's perfect, so this is your responsibility specifically. I'm not Mav, I'm a different person, I try to do my job and I put enough effort into it.

I agree with you that I need to adjust my time, I'm looking into that, I'll try to work it out and be on call during my msk business hours, I generally have trouble sleeping. It's not your problem, but I think it's good for you to know."

Your job and others who are involved, to give me access, code, servers and everything I need to work efficiently, I don't think it's perfect, so this is your responsibility specifically. I'm not Mav, I'm a different person, I try to do my job and I put enough effort into it. I'm not going to work my ass off, working 'to get results' and around the clock is a direct way to burn out, if you think I'm a function, I don't agree with that approach and I'll keep insisting on it.
