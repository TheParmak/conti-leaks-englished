[27.10.21 13:36:06] angelo: so what
[27.10.21 13:36:13] angelo: you've been screwing around for half a day.
[27.10.21 13:36:52] wild: in a hurry or not?
[27.10.21 13:37:00] wild: I was asked to make a manual from Sem
[27.10.21 13:37:03] wild: ideally
[27.10.21 13:37:24] angelo: not in a hurry
[27.10.21 13:37:54] wild: ok I ordered from SAM, I'll check it and give it to you

[27.10.21 14:55:49] angelo: you poke me with a stick
[27.10.21 14:56:34] wild: from the panel the crypt is ready, checked and packed
[27.10.21 14:56:42] wild: if there's no time
[27.10.21 14:57:03] wild: but I was tagged as follows
```
preferably order from SAM to have a good crypt
```
[27.10.21 14:57:08] angelo: tell me how long you need
[27.10.21 14:57:16] angelo: half an hour
[27.10.21 14:57:17] angelo: an hour
[27.10.21 14:57:22] angelo: I've got dinner on the spit
[27.10.21 14:57:24] angelo: I have to finish it
[27.10.21 14:57:38] wild: the thing is, I ordered from Sem, but he has no time to know)
[27.10.21 14:57:52] angelo: got it
[27.10.21 14:57:55] wild: so just if you need it urgently write me I'll give it right away from the panel
[27.10.21 14:57:59] angelo: no big deal
[27.10.21 14:58:19] angelo: the main thing is to have a good crypt, I'll run it on a long time uk
[27.10.21 14:58:31] wild: +
[27.10.21 18:39:11] wild: ok
[27.10.21 18:39:13] wild: stop
[27.10.21 18:39:29] wild: here?
[27.10.21 18:39:47] angelo: I seem to be sleeping here
[27.10.21 18:39:54] angelo: rocket and i are one
[27.10.21 18:40:06] angelo: I think I'll be making babies near my laptop
[27.10.21 18:40:12] wild: why haven't you kicked me?
[27.10.21 18:40:23] wild: do you have SAM tab in cryptopane?
[27.10.21 18:40:28] angelo: yes
[27.10.21 18:40:40] wild: dl_39_release_nologs_group_39_ver_1_52_x64_regsvr32.dll
[27.10.21 18:40:44] wild: that's what you need
[27.10.21 18:41:18] wild: super wild
[27.10.21 18:41:22] wild: manual
[27.10.21 18:41:23] angelo: )
[27.10.21 18:41:33] angelo: just wondering
[27.10.21 18:41:57] angelo: Colin said to warn if it's run with a cloud
[27.10.21 18:42:07] angelo: does it count if I already warned him today or not (
[27.10.21 18:42:31] angelo: his words
[27.10.21 18:42:31] angelo: i don't know your current tasks, if they say do it with cloud, do it with cloud, just warn me
with the cloud you need a clean machine and a separate crypt, that's how it was before
[27.10.21 18:42:59] wild: there's a perfect crypt from sim
[27.10.21 18:43:08] wild: I think it's fine
[27.10.21 18:43:16] angelo: i think so too
[27.10.21 18:43:21] angelo: i don't need colin for the test
[27.10.21 18:43:27] angelo: but i think i'll run it in the morning
[27.10.21 18:43:35] angelo: will crypt go bad do you think ?
[27.10.21 18:43:40] angelo: or better now damn
[27.10.21 18:43:54] angelo: I can't leave my laptop all night, VPN drops sometimes
[27.10.21 18:44:03] angelo: what do you think?
[27.10.21 18:44:32] wild: in the last 3 hours he gave out 11 crypts
[27.10.21 18:44:43] angelo: yeah
[27.10.21 18:44:49] angelo: better today
[27.10.21 18:44:58] wild: I don't know, I don't like to take a prediction
[27.10.21 18:45:01] angelo: get dirty
[27.10.21 18:45:21] angelo: I sit till 2:00 with the client
[27.10.21 18:45:33] angelo: have 4 hours
[27.10.21 18:45:36] angelo: so I start in 10 min
[27.10.21 18:46:02] wild: ``
Yes from sam you can.
But only if the client insists
We usually do it without the cloud
because the cloud tends to leak the sample
It's better to have it working for the client
```
[27.10.21 18:46:03] angelo: it is quite enough to check without load the work of the uk with def
[27.10.21 18:46:47] angelo: and the assembly is only going to work ?
[27.10.21 18:46:54] wild: ``
tell me not to just race the cloud
```
[27.10.21 18:46:55] angelo: i don't know, honestly
[27.10.21 18:47:07] wild: that's what they say in general, I just remember some new ones with the cloud
[27.10.21 18:47:23] wild: this build is already in progress
[27.10.21 18:47:44] wild: but today not SAM did, but then again it's only about loder
[27.10.21 18:47:58] angelo: I'll run it in short
[27.10.21 18:48:03] wild: +
[27.10.21 18:48:09] angelo: Colin knows and was warned
[27.10.21 18:48:10] angelo: + zero car
[27.10.21 18:48:18] angelo: made it on purpose
[27.10.21 18:48:25] wild: you never rolled back?
[27.10.21 18:48:30] angelo: no
[27.10.21 18:48:34] wild: cool
[27.10.21 18:48:38] angelo: I change them very, very often]
[27.10.21 18:48:41] angelo: sometimes every day
[27.10.21 18:48:46] angelo: I have about a dozen of them
[27.10.21 18:49:07] wild: look, that's respect
[27.10.21 18:49:14] angelo: i pour cocoa, close my eyes and my hands make a couple by themselves ))
[27.10.21 18:49:29] angelo: opened my eyes and wham, the windup is )))) aha
[27.10.21 18:49:49] angelo: the main thing is not to clone machines
[27.10.21 18:49:57] wild: no kidding, it's cool that you do that
[27.10.21 18:50:14] angelo: you know, you got into this habit
[27.10.21 18:50:21] angelo: like meditation
[27.10.21 18:50:49] angelo: thank you for the crypto
[27.10.21 18:51:04] angelo: as I understood the launch with regsvr32
[27.10.21 18:51:55] wild: yeah
[27.10.21 18:51:56] wild: that's right
[27.10.21 18:52:04] angelo: ok
[27.10.21 18:52:21] angelo: I'll go make cocoa, main thing is not to close your eyes, I have no free space :D

[27.10.21 18:57:21] angelo: yeah, you can do better than that.)

[27.10.21 19:37:25] wild: like that, 10 to 15 minutes at the most
[27.10.21 19:37:33] angelo: got it.
[27.10.21 19:37:39] angelo: You get used to a few minutes
[27.10.21 19:37:53] angelo: You sit there and then you bite your nails till your elbows
[27.10.21 19:38:04] wild: yeah, i agree, i'm out of feet already

[19.11.21 09:19:36] angelo: Those words in the alleys, a kind sadness
Of enchanted couples, but I will not return.
She'll wake in the darkness alone
And that autumn morning is like night. Again
Paints a watercolor in the yellow colors of hope.
The shore of desires, tender words. Again
Autumn asked me to endure until winter.
Asked me to be strong like you
[19.11.21 09:19:58] angelo: how many years have passed and I'm still amazed by the lines of their tracks
[19.11.21 09:20:06] wild: oh, the times of crack are the times of vodka winter of bad plan and black nine

[27.01.22 18:16:11] wild: i don't feel sorry, on the contrary, i think, that it is necessary to give some money, if only i had it now))
[27.01.22 18:16:16] wild: I'll throw it in now
[27.01.22 18:18:25] wild: [ ](https://xflemdsxjrjilw34dsxpvrxp5whnaut7hc5xejwuqs6eqrkt77bxkwid.onion/direct/qHkSuNAj6CsTKNeugxG9LtftkDuopdGZfc?msg=3kXvssSjBFPCkD4wF) paid

[27.01.22 18:19:59] wild: although i couldn't get any tonight myself
[27.01.22 18:20:03] wild: can't fuckin' do anything
[27.01.22 18:20:14] angelo: if you told me to sign up 15 for 30 bucks, I would have told you to sign up yourself.)
[27.01.22 18:20:16] wild: my back hurts, I can't concentrate on anything
[27.01.22 18:20:19] wild: fuck
[27.01.22 18:20:22] wild: angelo
[27.01.22 18:20:30] wild: where are all my fucking boys from the yard
[27.01.22 18:20:43] angelo: would have told him to register himself, but he would have helped him)
[27.01.22 18:20:43] wild: that would have kicked my ass for that shit
[27.01.22 18:20:50] angelo: I don't need 30 bucks for a guy in trouble
[27.01.22 18:21:00] angelo: let's see what's up with the soaps and ipses
[27.01.22 18:21:02] wild: as a token of love and concern
[27.01.22 18:21:18] wild: thanks
[27.01.22 18:21:23] wild: you want a joke
[27.01.22 18:21:32] wild: my neighbor's pushing a nut
[27.01.22 18:22:00] wild: and i was drunk yesterday (i had a reason, i felt very fucked up, my ex had a baby yesterday and she didn't even tell me, i heard from 3 people)
[27.01.22 18:22:15] wild: He won't even put it on the birth certificate
[27.01.22 18:22:29] wild: Bitch is the only woman I wanted kids with
[27.01.22 18:22:34] wild: not since 2007
[27.01.22 18:22:45] wild: well, i'm drunk
[27.01.22 18:22:55] wild: agreed to hold such a marathon
[27.01.22 18:22:58] wild: oh man
[27.01.22 18:22:59] wild: awful.
[27.01.22 18:23:19] angelo: nut ?
[27.01.22 18:23:25] angelo: hash?
[27.01.22 18:24:08] wild: nut is the first
[27.01.22 18:24:08] wild: coke
[27.01.22 18:24:18] wild: i fucked up yesterday, i'm ashamed to say what
[27.01.22 18:24:21] wild: with a tramp
[27.01.22 18:24:26] wild: it was just so fucked up
[27.01.22 18:24:55] wild: imagine
[27.01.22 18:25:03] angelo: +- I can imagine when my soul is turned inside out
[27.01.22 18:25:10] wild: they give me a nut at wholesale price even for 0.1 :D
[27.01.22 18:25:20] angelo: fuck you
[27.01.22 18:25:36] wild: I called a stalker who blows up treasures around town and gave it to him
[27.01.22 18:25:39] wild: to be spied on
[27.01.22 18:25:44] wild: and even when I saw what he brought
[27.01.22 18:26:02] wild: more juice
[27.01.22 18:26:23] wild: I stopped communicating with two very nice guys a couple of years ago, I broke off all contacts
[27.01.22 18:26:27] wild: because of that shit
[27.01.22 18:26:29] wild: and himself huh
[27.01.22 18:26:48] wild: just fall into a pit of sadness, get drunk and that's it
[27.01.22 18:26:52] wild: it goes like this.
[27.01.22 18:27:07] angelo: fuck it
[27.01.22 18:27:10] angelo: fuck it
[27.01.22 18:27:13] angelo: fucking pit
[27.01.22 18:27:16] wild: i told the herald he changed his voice
[27.01.22 18:27:24] wild: yeah
[27.01.22 18:27:31] wild: that's what I mean
[27.01.22 18:28:14] wild: it's been my 5th year, I've been doing pills once a week, once or twice a month, a nut, and sometimes I get high once every 3 months for some ecstasy
[27.01.22 18:28:19] wild: echoes of youth
[27.01.22 18:28:27] wild: used to eat everything
[27.01.22 18:28:27] wild: that's it
[27.01.22 18:28:29] wild: so
[27.01.22 18:28:38] wild: never would have guessed
[27.01.22 18:28:43] wild: that I would tell that to anybody here
[27.01.22 18:28:54] wild: i think even i treat torks similarly
[27.01.22 18:29:02] wild: a guy came to me to change internet
[27.01.22 18:29:05] wild: on monday)
[27.01.22 18:29:17] wild: I just saw him, I knew he was a junkie
[27.01.22 18:29:29] wild: not a user
[27.01.22 18:29:31] wild: he's a junkie
[27.01.22 18:29:46] wild: so when he finished I gave him some hash
[27.01.22 18:29:55] wild: he really jumped up and down
[27.01.22 18:30:08] angelo: I was sitting down myself
[27.01.22 18:30:10] wild: and then i realized i gave hash to a stranger who had all my info
[27.01.22 18:30:11] angelo: 3 years
[27.01.22 18:30:11] wild: yeah
[27.01.22 18:30:17] angelo: 15 years ago
[27.01.22 18:30:31] angelo: shut the fuck up
[27.01.22 18:30:49] angelo: i almost went away for 12 years
[27.01.22 18:31:08] wild: 15 years ago I was rushing from Kyzyl in a black four-car with 2 bags of handbrake boxes for 300 rubles, on arrival in my town they went up depending on who by 3.5 - 5k
[27.01.22 18:31:17] wild: yeah, i gave it up a long time ago
[27.01.22 18:31:22] wild: I'm 30 years old
[27.01.22 18:31:28] wild: I've been called out by guys
[27.01.22 18:32:43] wild: [ ](https://xflemdsxjrjilw34dsxpvrxp5whnaut7hc5xejwuqs6eqrkt77bxkwid.onion/direct/qHkSuNAj6CsTKNeugxG9LtftkDuopdGZfc?msg=eZqsn5FgqhpXBETc3) I have an excuse, I was born in a "junkie yard" and into a family of officials (my father's a bandit, but from the ccsps anyway)
[27.01.22 18:32:50] angelo: you have a good job now, i don't know how much you get paid, but you can't find a job like this
[27.01.22 18:33:01] angelo: mine is also a gangster
[27.01.22 18:33:02] wild: There are three people in my neighborhood who haven't tried heroin
[27.01.22 18:33:06] wild: me and my two tatar friends
[27.01.22 18:33:07] angelo: we are street, we are similar
[27.01.22 18:33:15] wild: a couple of rubles
[27.01.22 18:33:16] wild: normal
[27.01.22 18:33:21] wild: not a hot job
[27.01.22 18:33:26] wild: all the more so interesting connections
[27.01.22 18:33:28] wild: we won't get lost
[27.01.22 18:33:53] wild: I already have all the contacts to.....
[27.01.22 18:34:01] wild: only this is between you and me
[27.01.22 18:34:16] wild: if I were your boss, I'd fire you for saying that
[27.01.22 18:34:50] wild: I also used to fire you for lesser sins)
[27.01.22 18:36:45] angelo: come on, bro, I've got tests.)
[27.01.22 18:36:46] angelo: couple of minutes
[27.01.22 18:38:41] wild: I'm gonna go lie down
[27.01.22 18:38:42] wild: no more
[27.01.22 18:38:59] angelo: go ahead
[27.01.22 18:39:31] angelo: strictly between us, but always be careful, not every friend who seems like a friend, be careful !
[27.01.22 18:46:54] wild: agree
[27.01.22 18:47:07] wild: but manuel said you're yours
[27.01.22 18:47:13] wild: and I've been with him half my life
[27.01.22 18:48:01] wild: and all in all, i communicate with 3 people here
[27.01.22 18:48:07] wild: of those I don't know personally
[27.01.22 18:48:36] wild: you, Ned and lately Hugo, we always interact with him on cryptos
[27.01.22 18:49:00] wild: do you know Ned?
[27.01.22 18:49:07] wild: Ghost
[27.01.22 18:50:43] angelo: know him
[27.01.22 18:50:48] angelo: not an easy guy )
[27.01.22 18:51:46] angelo: I'm still poking around in Hera's soaps)
[27.01.22 18:53:04] angelo: but you should quit it, I had one lady, in my life I almost came to the end because of her
[27.01.22 19:11:26] angelo: I'm busy with mine, when I'm free I'll continue
[27.01.22 19:11:28] angelo: I'm getting fucked here
[27.01.22 19:11:51] wild: the question is purely out of curiosity; why do you write VPS not by the rules?)
[27.01.22 19:12:18] angelo: what rules?)
[27.01.22 19:12:25] wild: come on!
[27.01.22 19:12:29] angelo: what the fuck regulations 7)
