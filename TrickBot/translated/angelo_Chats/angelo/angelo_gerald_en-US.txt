[10.11.21 18:21:28] gerald: only with tools
[10.11.21 18:22:09] angelo: just a minute

[10.11.21 21:12:41] gerald: what will be the schedule?
[10.11.21 21:12:42] angelo: set up office/vinar and broser at once
[10.11.21 21:12:46] angelo: FF and chrome

[10.11.21 21:13:17] angelo: It's too late
[10.11.21 21:13:23] gerald: accepted
[10.11.21 21 21:13:45] angelo: come on, good day
[11.11.21 07:55:00] gerald: hi.
[11.11.21 07:55:10] angelo: hi
[11.11.21 07:56:01] angelo: after you set the axis, with the set of programs and updates, make snaps
[11.11.21 07:56:14] angelo: to roll back to them
[11.11.21 07:57:10] angelo: usually the wind is enough for a couple of weeks to make the tests clean, sometimes the wind is glitchy
[11.11.21 07:57:48] gerald: put one osce, upgrading completely, snap made
[11.11.21 07:57:59] gerald: ff, winrar, what else?
[11.11.21 07:58:06] angelo: chrome
[11.11.21 07:58:20] gerald: +
[11.11.21 07:59:05] angelo: ProcessExplorer
[11.11.21 08:31:43] gerald: 2 vm total?
[11.11.21 08:32:51] angelo: you need three
[11.11.21 08:32:57] angelo: 7 10 and a server one
[11.11.21 08:33:09] angelo: usually test in knitting
[11.11.21 08:33:21] angelo: depending on the problem
[11.11.21 08:33:30] angelo: we have 10s in the main, of course
[11.11.21 08:33:42] angelo: I used 2019
[11.11.21 08:33:53] angelo: take your time, put it up, you got a lot to do
[11.11.21 08:34:04] gerald: +
[11.11.21 08:34:18] gerald: 7
[11.11.21 08:36:44] angelo: yes, you need 7, it often has problems
[11.11.21 09:12:07] angelo: you know how to do it (if you didn't do it)
[11.11.21 09:12:33] angelo: drop the soit on a separate VM car
[11.11.21 09:12:57] angelo: make yourself a folder with the necessary software so it would be convenient to throw the pile, it is so convenient for me
[11.11.21 09:15:29] gerald: i guess i didn't get it right. should i download the software to a separate vm?
[11.11.21 09:15:53] gerald: you want to make a folder on VM?
[11.11.21 09:16:35] angelo: well, look.
[11.11.21 09:16:49] angelo: so you made a car and started to download the software separately
[11.11.21 09:17:09] angelo: but you can make a collection of required software and upload it to each VM
[11.11.21 09:17:19] gerald: got it
[11.11.21 09:17:57] angelo: you just might need a couple more plugins and you'll need 5-7 more, it's easier the way I wrote
[11.11.21 09:18:46] gerald: you said you needed 10, 7 and the server one.
[11.11.21 09:19:02] gerald: 10 is, 7 is, what to do with the last item
[11.11.21 09:19:10] angelo: sec
[11.11.21 09:19:43] angelo: find windows server 2019
[11.11.21 09:19:49] angelo: there is definitely on torrents
[11.11.21 09:19:51] angelo: check it out
[11.11.21 09:19:54] angelo: you need it too
[11.11.21 09:19:56] gerald: ok
[11.11.21 09:39:54] gerald: is there a 10-to-18 schedule?
[11.11.21 09:40:29] angelo: well done for reminding
[11.11.21 09:40:32] angelo: let's decide
[11.11.21 09:43:43] angelo: let's do it that way yes
[11.11.21 09:45:33] angelo: let's do it yes
[11.11.21 09:45:38] angelo: 10 to 18
[11.11.21 10:46:59] gerald: will Windows Server 2019 only be needed on my computer?
[11.11.21 10:47:38] angelo: I don't understand the question
[11.11.21 10:47:41] angelo: where else?
[11.11.21 10:47:46] angelo: he needs it for VM
[11.11.21 10:47:49] angelo: yours
[11.11.21 10:48:23] gerald: I created VMware Workstation Pro
[11.11.21 10:49:48] angelo: by the way
[11.11.21 10:50:02] angelo: no tasks yet
[11.11.21 10:50:07] angelo: download more 11
[11.11.21 10:50:11] angelo: we'll need it by now
[11.11.21 10:50:22] gerald: ok
[11.11.21 10:50:35] angelo: we'll be checking on them too
[11.11.21 10:51:53] angelo: VM should have TPM support
[11.11.21 10:52:09] angelo: you know it ? 11 vinda need it when installing
[11.11.21 10:52:23] angelo: encryption module
[11.11.21 10:52:23] gerald: didn't know
[11.11.21 10:53:12] angelo: but check if it's there or not
[11.11.21 10:53:17] angelo: via WIN+R
[11.11.21 10:53:28] angelo: tpm.msc
[11.11.21 10:53:45] angelo: and in the window will appear info about module availability
[11.11.21 10:57:36] angelo: if you don't understand something, write any question
[11.11.21 10:58:19] gerald: writes capital tpm not found
[11.11.21 10:58:39] angelo: no problem
[11.11.21 10:58:43] angelo: there's a way around it
[11.11.21 10:58:51] angelo: disable module check by registry
[11.11.21 10:59:10] angelo: https://www.comss.ru/page.php?id=9593
[11.11.21 10:59:41] angelo: this works
[11.11.21 11:01:19] angelo: there is VirtualBox, but it doesn't matter.
[11.11.21 11:01:32] gerald: already downloading
[11.11.21 11:15:11] gerald: I'll let you know when 11
[11.11.21 11:15:23] angelo: go ahead
[11.11.21 11:15:25] angelo: take your time
[11.11.21 11:15:35] angelo: no clear instructions for tests yet
[11.11.21 11:55:45] gerald: at 17:30 will it be possible to leave for an hour?
[11.11.21 11:56:51] angelo: saw ?

[11.11.21 11:57:23] angelo: ok
[11.11.21 11:57:54] gerald: at 5:30 p.m. will it be possible to leave for an hour?
[11.11.21 11:58:49] angelo: ok
[11.11.21 11:58:57] angelo: when it's free you can, but give me a warning
[11.11.21 11:59:03] angelo: it's a good habit and necessary
[11.11.21 11:59:08] gerald: accepted
[11.11.21 18:19:27] angelo: test
[11.11.21 18:19:39] gerald: here
[11.11.21 18:20:32] angelo: short
[11.11.21 18:20:39] angelo: I'll try to figure it out
[11.11.21 18:20:45] angelo: and I'll think what to load ok ?
[11.11.21 18:21:01] gerald: i have this stupid problem with vin 11. iso from the off site, i did everything according to the manual, but nothing.
[11.11.21 18:21:22] gerald: Is it cool if I put it on virtualbox?
[11.11.21 18:21:30] angelo: well, it is not burned, i think i just leave it
[11.11.21 18:21:37] angelo: sure
[11.11.21 18:21:41] angelo: not important
[11.11.21 18:21:49] angelo: how much RAM do you have ?
[11.11.21 18:21:54] gerald: 16
[11.11.21 18:21:55] angelo: on your machine
[11.11.21 18:22:07] angelo: already bread
[11.11.21 18:22:25] angelo: sat on 32 and sighed
[11.11.21 18:22:48] angelo: when I was in a jam, I had to hit 5-6 cars
[11.11.21 18:22:48] gerald: about the load - the very process of work with you too?
[11.11.21 18:23:03] angelo: +- yes
[11.11.21 18:23:13] angelo: tasks come from different directions
[11.11.21 18:23:22] angelo: if you have any questions, write
[11.11.21 18:24:16] angelo: yes, the main thing - we always on all machines, EVERYTHING we do always turn off the Simple sub
[11.11.21 18:24:23] angelo: sending samples
[11.11.21 18:24:30] angelo: under Windows Security
[11.11.21 18:25:11] gerald: I mean we disable it on virtual machines, right?
[11.11.21 18:25:22] angelo: everywhere
[11.11.21 18:25:33] angelo: just in case what will be on your car
[11.11.21 18:25:44] angelo: just in case it detects and windup
[11.11.21 18:25:55] angelo: put it down right away
[11.11.21 18:26:10] angelo: got it?
[11.11.21 18:26:26] gerald: turn off all windows security
[11.11.21 18:26:34] gerald: that's what we're talking about
[11.11.21 18:27:14] angelo: in this case we speak about one point
[11.11.21 18:27:31] angelo: there are tests that we need AB to check the detector
[11.11.21 18:27:45] angelo: go to Windows Security
[11.11.21 18:27:47] angelo: now
[11.11.21 18:28:05] gerald: +
[11.11.21 18:28:29] angelo: Virus and protection
[11.11.21 18:28:41] angelo: Manage settings
[11.11.21 18:29:04] angelo: Automatic Simple Submission
[11.11.21 18:29:22] angelo: this option must be always disabled everywhere
[11.11.21 18:29:42] gerald: accepted
[11.11.21 18:29:49] gerald: I want to read the rules
[11.11.21 18:30:09] gerald: any variant?
[11.11.21 18:30:18] angelo: go question for question
[11.11.21 18:30:26] gerald: go ahead
[11.11.21 18:30:27] angelo: what do you mean by regulations in our case
[11.11.21 18:31:32] gerald: good question)
[11.11.21 18:31:42] angelo: tricky )
[11.11.21 18:31:48] angelo: I was given you to help with technical issues, it can be from and to. Tasks are usually simple.
[11.11.21 18:32:01] angelo: nothing complicated
[11.11.21 18:32:16] gerald: no more questions)
[11.11.21 18:32:33] angelo: just when you have two hands it can be physically difficult, as in my case, and I was given your two hands, because I can not grow
[11.11.21 18:32:40] angelo: )
[11.11.21 18:32:59] gerald: got it)
[11.11.21 18:33:14] gerald: tomorrow at 10, right?
[11.11.21 18:34:29] angelo: Right.)
[11.11.21 18:34:34] angelo: you're important
[11.11.21 18:34:36] angelo: Ask away
[11.11.21 18:34:50] angelo: No need for weather, I'm not a meteorologist
[11.11.21 18:35:01] angelo: but ask like that, I'll always answer
[11.11.21 18:35:04] angelo: That's our rule
[11.11.21 18:35:40] gerald: I'll ask questions like that at first
[11.11.21 18:36:11] angelo: I still ask them
[11.11.21 18:36:16] angelo: and that's great
[11.11.21 18:36:56] angelo: anyway, don't worry if you were worried]
[11.11.21 18:37:12] gerald: I count on it)
[11.11.21 18:37:20] gerald: see you tomorrow then
[11.11.21 18:37:32] angelo: ok
[11.11.21 18:37:34] angelo: see you tomorrow
[12.11.21 07:59:40] angelo: you know, i'm a stickler for vpn changes
[12.11.21 07:59:46] angelo: no what better to put
[12.11.21 08:00:00] angelo: if you ask others, everyone will be happy for their choice
[12.11.21 08:00:07] angelo: but in fact it's better not to be tied
[12.11.21 08:00:36] angelo: alternate
[12.11.21 08:01:10] angelo: I had a NordVPN Seed4me or the same OpenVPN
[12.11.21 08:01:19] angelo: I was chaotically using different in the process
[12.11.21 08:01:53] angelo: trust no one, there are logs everywhere and everyone can see them in bigdate
[12.11.21 08:02:36] angelo: of course it's better to do your own, but it's not the way
[12.11.21 08:03:56] angelo: if we're talking about simple tests, you shouldn't bother. There are certain tasks. I have a VM with Tor stretched into it. That is a VPN + Thor. There is Ubuntu with another World Wide Web, so I get double World Wide Web + Tor. But again, this is for different tasks
[12.11.21 08:04:41] angelo: you can not trust your traffic to one service, whatever it is, cloud storage or VPN
[12.11.21 08:04:51] angelo: normal explained ?)
[12.11.21 08:05:46] gerald: i.e. i download several vpn and i switch between them during the day, right?
[12.11.21 08:06:22] angelo: yes, well, during the day it is too much, I think, I got away from it myself )
[12.11.21 08:06:45] angelo: but you can alternate ipN in one VPN
[12.11.21 08:07:07] angelo: I buy left IpN
[12.11.21 08:07:41] angelo: in general, leftist accounts are our everything, they are broken or they are flogged, it does not matter for us
[12.11.21 08:08:09] angelo: on the machine where you work, do not use your account at all, not on VM, but on yours, it may happen
[12.11.21 08:10:17] gerald: i.e. do not open yandex music, trolley and so on during work?
[12.11.21 08:10:25] gerald: there are my accounts
[12.11.21 08:10:59] angelo: well, how can i tell you, i wouldn't recommend it
[12.11.21 08:11:54] angelo: open, but to the left ones.)
[12.11.21 08:13:16] angelo: accidentally leaked info, just a couple days ago my foreman found out he leaked his coma data, accidentally ran it on the main machine
[12.11.21 08:13:51] gerald: does it matter what country IP will be?
[12.11.21 08:13:59] angelo: everything except rU
[12.11.21 08:14:00] gerald: or just usa?
[12.11.21 08:14:04] gerald: got it
[12.11.21 08:14:04] angelo: no
[12.11.21 08:14:24] angelo: it doesn't matter, there are tests where you can have a filter on the ip, and ask to do strictly US
[12.11.21 08:21:08] gerald: the problem was originally today with ipn - through Wpn-local network writes that no access to the internet. either one or the other. i do not understand what the problem is
[12.11.21 08:23:14] angelo: I can not help in the fine technical points, especially on the phone poorly visible
[12.11.21 08:23:16] angelo: read
[12.11.21 08:23:25] angelo: google
[12.11.21 08:23:32] angelo: it can be like this after the OPENVPN

[23.11.21 14:41:17] gerald: rolled back
[23.11.21 14:41:22] angelo: ok
[23.11.21 14:41:24] angelo: yes
[23.11.21 14:41:34] angelo: for this test you have to clear your cookies

[23.11.21 14:42:10] angelo: look
[23.11.21 14:42:15] angelo: we check cookies in chrome
[23.11.21 14:42:23] angelo: that means we only need CROM
[23.11.21 14:42:32] angelo: and the module grabs all cookies from all browsers
[23.11.21 14:42:44] angelo: understand ?
[23.11.21 14:43:00] angelo: a module is a program that is loaded by a bot on VM
[23.11.21 14:44:13] gerald: i cleared the cookies. now i'm running the bot, right?
[11/23/221 14:44:44] angelo: yes.
[23.11.21 14:44:53] angelo: and you can log into your google account
[23.11.21 14:45:01] angelo: you have to google.com
[23.11.21 14:45:29] gerald: can you enter your google account via working vpn on vm?
[23.11.21 14:45:41] angelo: yes
[23.11.21 14:45:48] angelo: where we run the bot
[23.11.21 14:46:17] gerald: is it safe? we're talking about my google account where all my info is
[11/23/11/21 14:46:54] angelo: okay.

[23.11.21 14:47:28] gerald: come on
[23.11.21 14:47:40] angelo: we don't use ours
[23.11.21 14:47:44] angelo: just like you said then
[23.11.21 14:47:46] angelo: nothing of our own

[24.11.21 11:18:55] angelo: let's get the bot
[24.11.21 11:19:06] gerald: are you asking if vm is off?
[24.11.21 11:19:16] angelo: yeah
[24.11.21 11:19:18] angelo: turn it on
[24.11.21 11:19:24] gerald: okay.

[24.11.21 11:26:41] gerald: 4460
[24.11.21 11:27:07] gerald: yeah, strange, that's why I decided to make a reload now

[24.11.21 11:28:53] gerald: kaf
[24.11.21 11:29:04] angelo: yeah, handy, I had to increase memory
[24.11.21 11:29:21] gerald: 32 maybe?
[24.11.21 11:29:28] gerald: RAM
[11/24/11/21 11:29:56] angelo: yeah
[24.11.21 11:30:04] gerald: ok
[24.11.21 11:30:08] angelo: decided to make notebook combat
[24.11.21 11:30:28] angelo: medium graphics, but you don't need it +-
[24.11.21 11:33:37] gerald: run it. all is ok, in general all 4 are off
[24.11.21 11:34:35] angelo: now
[11/24/11/21 11:35:21] angelo: KJSl8o292002j-0k-a0-()@Hs;da'sj9d
[24.11.21 11:35:56] angelo: https://file.io/bty7Z1JVt7rV

[24.11.21 11:39:01] angelo: yeah
[24.11.21 11:39:04] angelo: take your time
[24.11.21 11:39:09] angelo: I'm checking my own.
[24.11.21 11:39:14] angelo: we have the same email account
[24.11.21 11:39:35] gerald: got it. tell me when to run the bot
[24.11.21 11:47:50] angelo: another 10 minutes
[24.11.21 11:47:59] angelo: waiting for cookies to load on my vm and give you the account
[24.11.21 11:48:11] gerald: +
[24.11.21 11:54:19] angelo: go ahead
[24.11.21 11:54:28] gerald: +
[24.11.21 11:54:52] gerald: you have to go to the jmail afterwards?
[24.11.21 11:54:59] angelo: yes
[24.11.21 11:55:00] angelo: I'll send it over.
[24.11.21 11:55:11] angelo: hilliandra23@gmail.com qp9c902729hnsdf
[24.11.21 11:56:19] gerald: leave cookies and cache untouched yes?
[24.11.21 11:56:34] angelo: on chrome don't
[24.11.21 13:36:17] angelo: failed to check
[24.11.21 13:36:26] angelo: no cookies from machine in admin
[24.11.21 13:36:34] angelo: and admin will pant to fix
[24.11.21 13:36:49] angelo: while we enjoy our freedom
[24.11.21 13:36:49] gerald: did i do something wrong?
[24.11.21 13:36:54] angelo: no
[24.11.21 13:37:02] angelo: the ccs from bot go into the panel
[24.11.21 13:37:07] angelo: cookies
[24.11.21 13:37:10] gerald: aah. ugh)
[24.11.21 13:37:28] angelo: and should have checked how they go - normal or not
[24.11.21 13:37:34] angelo: admin admin is responsible for that
[24.11.21 13:37:48] angelo: and not the right result yet
[24.11.21 13:37:49] gerald: can I turn VM off for now?
[24.11.21 13:37:54] angelo: go ahead
[24.11.21 13:38:00] angelo: not enough power ?
[24.11.21 13:38:10] angelo: strange for your computer
[24.11.21 13:38:22] angelo: like vmc only has one core
[24.11.21 13:38:41] gerald: no, ok. I figured it out, fixed it
[24.11.21 13:38:53] gerald: now it takes at most 40% of CPU when vm is on
[24.11.21 13:39:52] angelo: Oh, man!
[24.11.21 13:40:04] angelo: is it an old i5 ?
[24.11.21 13:40:09] angelo: it eats too much vm
[24.11.21 13:40:22] gerald: not new, yeah
[24.11.21 13:40:35] gerald: waiting for kamos upgrade)
[24.11.21 13:40:59] angelo: notebooks are more profitable now
[24.11.21 13:41:07] angelo: if not overloaded too much
[24.11.21 13:41:43] angelo: although i sold my pisuk with a heartbeat
[24.11.21 13:41:44] gerald: Prices of laptops are pretty steep nowadays
[24.11.21 13:41:57] angelo: yeah, if you snatch it on sale
[24.11.21 13:42:02] angelo: waited 3 months
[24.11.21 13:42:12] angelo: even took the previous model
[24.11.21 13:43:14] angelo: but the graphics cards cost like airplane
[24.11.21 13:43:47] gerald: I get a single tear when I look at graphics cards price list
[24.11.21 13:45:03] angelo: that's why I tore out my laptop
[24.11.21 13:45:10] angelo: 2060 is 60K
[24.11.21 13:45:22] gerald: tough
[24.11.21 13:45:29] angelo: you can get a 3060 laptop for 80
[24.11.21 13:51:22] gerald: does it make sense to restart your machine after working with vm?
[24.11.21 14:14:18] angelo: nope
[24.11.21 14:14:21] angelo: none
[24.11.21 14:14:35] angelo: VM sits in memory not on hard
[24.11.21 14:14:43] gerald: got it
[24.11.21 14:19:07] angelo: roll it back
[24.11.21 14:19:18] angelo: because bot is sitting in the processes and on the hard
[24.11.21 14:19:19] gerald: snapshot?
[24.11.21 14:19:23] angelo: yeah
[24.11.21 14:19:40] gerald: yes, every time before leaving
[24.11.21 14:19:51] angelo: yeah
[24.11.21 14:20:00] angelo: sometimes we don't, but it depends on the situation
[24.11.21 14:20:11] gerald: got it
[11/24/21/221 14:53:38] gerald: tomorrow at 10:00
[24.11.21 15:26:26] angelo: go ahead
[24.11.21 15:26:27] angelo: good

[25.11.21 10:22:05] angelo: hard to say
[25.11.21 10:22:16] angelo: i'm doing what i did yesterday
[25.11.21 10:23:19] gerald: just will not be such, that in the first days of December Francis will tell me to fuck you, not salary, you did not do anything?)
[25.11.21 10:23:34] angelo: he won't
[25.11.21 10:23:43] angelo: Believe me, people are sitting and waiting for instructions.
[25.11.21 10:23:52] gerald: okay, got it.
[25.11.21 10:24:00] angelo: I'll find something for you to do, don't worry.)
[25.11.21 10:24:07] angelo: I don't like this kind of silence myself
[25.11.21 10:24:11] gerald: +
[25.11.21 10:24:18] angelo: but you think right
[25.11.21 12:10:42] gerald: I'll be gone for 15 min
[25.11.21 14:52:29] angelo: Damn, bro, I can't think of anything yet
[25.11.21 14:52:33] angelo: nothing on tests
[25.11.21 14:52:41] angelo: asked the superior
[25.11.21 14:52:46] angelo: what can we give
[25.11.21 14:53:31] gerald: and he what?
[25.11.21 14:53:49] angelo: nothing yet
[25.11.21 14:54:09] gerald: got it.
[25.11.21 14:54:13] angelo: clients are quiet too
[25.11.21 14:54:24] angelo: so let's meditate
[25.11.21 14:54:41] gerald: that's what I think I'll do.)

[26.11.21 10:35:51] gerald: angelo: do I correctly understand, that all testers of our department are also working in the team?
[26.11.21 10:37:02] gerald: I mean, all of them are without assignment
[26.11.21 10:37:08] angelo: mostly yes
[26.11.21 10:37:11] angelo: silence
[26.11.21 10:37:20] angelo: work in progress
[26.11.21 10:37:23] angelo: clients are still silent

[26.11.21 10:39:29] angelo: honestly not alone
[26.11.21 10:39:56] gerald: puzzled by the silence?
[26.11.21 10:40:00] angelo: yeah
[26.11.21 10:40:11] angelo: just when clients are active
[26.11.21 10:40:16] angelo: there are problems with the software
[26.11.21 10:40:21] angelo: broke here, broke there
[26.11.21 10:40:27] angelo: somewhere to change and check

[26.11.21 12:41:40] gerald: (
[26.11.21 12:42:50] gerald: now I'm even more afraid that they'll fuck me off with the salary)

[26.11.21 12:45:44] angelo: we have fines
[26.11.21 12:45:48] angelo: for those who are absent
[26.11.21 12:45:54] angelo: without a good reason
[26.11.21 12:45:59] angelo: waiting is also work

[26.11.21 12:47:56] gerald: got it
[26.11.21 12:49:25] angelo: it's not easy to teach without any example
[26.11.21 12:50:19] gerald: yeah, that's why I ask you every day - what's the movement?)
[26.11.21 12:50:36] angelo: that's good!
[26.11.21 12:50:45] angelo: you think I had nothing like that?)

[22.12.21 14:21:23] gerald: You mean family - brothers, sisters
[22.12.21 14:24:02] angelo: believe me, it's harder with wife ))
[22.12.21 14:24:27] gerald: I'll probably check it on myself in years to come))
[22.12.21 14:24:49] angelo: great time awaits you bro
[12/22/12/21 14:25:11] gerald: never thought i'd even think of getting married. but last month every 2 hours my thoughts pop into my head
[22.12.21 14:26:15] angelo: because you are you, and body / brain chemistry takes its toll + instincts
[22.12.21 14:26:20] angelo: it is normal, it is logical
[22.12.21 14:26:34] angelo: that's when I STILL thought about living with one
[22.12.21 14:26:39] angelo: mine didn't just freak out
[22.12.21 14:26:40] angelo: they settled down
[22.12.21 14:27:05] angelo: i couldn't miss a single skirt :D
[12/22/221 14:27:44] gerald: that's what's been bugging me all my life. everything's cool, great, but living with ONE made me shudder and deny it)
[22.12.21 14:28:39] angelo: you just have to go through a period before marriage
[22.12.21 14:28:40] gerald: probably for every man there comes a moment when past habits change
[22.12.21 14:28:48] gerald: 2 years at least.
[22.12.21 14:30:05] angelo: I have most of them around me
[22.12.21 14:30:19] angelo: relationships are hard work
[22.12.21 14:30:23] angelo: i'm a specialist)
[22.12.21 14:30:36] gerald: it looks like you're working on yourself first
[22.12.21 14:30:47] angelo: yeah.....
[22.12.21 14:30:51] angelo: it was very difficult for me
[22.12.21 14:30:53] angelo: breaking myself
[22.12.21 14:31:07] angelo: not to say fuck it, i've been doing it my whole life
[22.12.21 14:31:22] gerald: that's what scares me most.
[22.12.21 14:31:32] angelo: don't worry.)
[22.12.21 14:31:40] angelo: just need to understand for what or whom
[22.12.21 14:31:53] angelo: you know, tarkovsky said well in the interview.
[12/22/221 14:32:14] angelo: I'm a henchman. Why should I assert myself at the expense of the woman I love.
[22.12.21 14:32:31] gerald: deeply
[12/22/221 14:33:33] angelo: We are all selfish, and living with another person, you have to step on your throat, alas. But this is at first, then the angles get chiseled away, characters turn into yin and yang.
[22.12.21 14:33:41] angelo: don't worry!
[22.12.21 14:34:19] angelo: after going through life in a relationship, you can already say that everything will be fine
[22.12.21 14:34:22] gerald: bro, i just exhaled a little bit just now)
[22.12.21 14:34:27] gerald: thank you\.
[22.12.21 14:34:40] angelo: you're welcome.)
[22.12.21 14:34:56] angelo: like one guy says - helping others, you help yourself
[22.12.21 14:35:14] gerald: buddhist principle)
[22.12.21 14:35:37] angelo: yeah, it's easier to live like that
[22.12.21 14:35:54] gerald: especially in our northern latitudes
[22.12.21 14:36:08] gerald: I am not a herald for nothing)))
[22.12.21 14:36:10] angelo: I guess they say people there are tougher and kinder at the same time
[22.12.21 14:36:14] angelo: ))) exactly )

[12/30/221 07:23:01] angelo: I need you to do a little crypto
[12/30/221 07:23:29] gerald: also wanted to talk about it.
[12/30/21 07:23:32] gerald: in skins
[30.12.21 07:23:56] angelo: we'd keep going, just see there's a new project in december
[30.12.21 07:24:07] angelo: he comes to us conditionally from others
[12/30/221 07:24:20] angelo: that's why it was and is important to get used to it
[12/30/21 07:24:28] gerald: accepted
[30.12.21 07:24:42] gerald: I'll go buy coffee and pork samosa
[12/30/21 07:24:49] angelo: go ahead.
[30.12.21 07:24:54] angelo: samosa and pork.)
[12/30/221 07:25:12] gerald: Georgian samsa for 120 rubles, but I'm happy for 200 rubles)
[30.12.21 07:25:24] angelo: lucky you
[30.12.21 07:25:44] angelo: I have only one shawarma here, and it's dog food
[12/30/221 07:27:00] gerald: that's what, but in terms of food i'm lucky. maybe because i love uzbek, georgian and i've searched every place in the area
[12/30/221 07:28:06] gerald: type oriental cuisine into 2Google and you'll surely find a place near you where they even cook delicious food
[30.12.21 07:28:46] angelo: this is my weakness, I had to learn to cook like them)
[30.12.21 07:29:07] angelo: You must have national food there.
[12/30/221 07:31:12] gerald: it's the thing I like the post-Soviet culture for - for breakfast Georgian samsa with pork and onions, for lunch shurpa with lamb, and for dinner you can even indulge in dumplings
[30.12.21 08:20:54] angelo: I love megrelian khachipuri and hinklai
[30.12.21 08:21:05] angelo: and kutabs Azerbani!
[30.12.21 08:21:21] gerald: uffffff!
[30.12.21 08:21:50] angelo: say, I'll have to order today]
[30.12.21 08:22:10] angelo: leads the hacks, their wives cook divine
[30.12.21 08:22:37] gerald: even russians cook fine, if their mother got them used to it since childhood
[12/30/221 08:22:50] angelo: just imagine - my wife makes shawarma for me! my wife makes khinkali for lunch, and go make pastry)
[30.12.21 08:23:10] gerald: I lived like this for a year bro.)
[30.12.21 08:23:19] angelo: Fucking paradise!)
[12/30/21 08:23:24] gerald: +++
[12/30/21 08:23:41] angelo: wife for dinner, khinkali and blowjob :D
[12/30/21/221 08:23:53] gerald: that's 1in1
[12/30/221 08:23:59] angelo: and call your girlfriends!
[30.12.21 08:23:59] gerald: as if you were there and not me))
[12/30/21 08:24:05] angelo: ahahaha!)
[30.12.21 08:24:10] gerald: no, they take a long time to cook
[30.12.21 08:24:13] angelo: you were in heaven bro!
[30.12.21 08:24:23] gerald: in fact
[12/30/21 08:25:39] angelo: so look for a wife who can cook
[12/30/21 08:25:44] angelo: or I'll have to do it myself.)
[30.12.21 08:26:15] gerald: my wife is fucked up with my love for oriental food. she thinks they roast cats there
[30.12.21 08:26:46] gerald: she's latin racist, i think.)
[30.12.21 08:27:21] angelo: you should show her some suckling pig in our kitchen.)
[30.12.21 08:27:29] angelo: who gets dicked on the table by the fact.)
[30.12.21 08:27:46] gerald: I can't look at such things myself))
[30.12.21 08:27:57] gerald: all my childhood I watched them cut up sheep
[12/30/21 08:28:03] gerald: fuck it.)
[12/30/21 08:28:11] angelo: you're fucked up
[30.12.21 08:28:18] angelo: from the caucasus?)
[30.12.21 08:28:30] gerald: Nah, central asia.
[30.12.21 08:28:45] angelo: They were not oppressed in the 90s?
[30.12.21 08:28:52] angelo: I've heard about it.
[30.12.21 08:28:54] gerald: there were all kinds of things
[12/30/21 08:29:07] angelo: now they say it's starting again
[12/30/21 08:29:28] angelo: jackals
[30.12.21 08:29:51] angelo: but you're not racist, just like everyone else.)
[12/30/221 08:30:34] gerald: I understand there are people who are interested in this, but the point is that Kazakhs/Krigiz/Uzbeks have much more in common culturally than with those types who scream for separateness
[30.12.21 08:30:51] gerald: much more in common with russians
[12/30/21 08:31:33] angelo: You know, ethnicity is a relic of the past. It's easier to control the masses by nationality. I'm sure of it a hundred percent
[30.12.21 08:31:51] angelo: where nationalism is, there are always those who are interested at the top
[12/30/221 08:32:07] gerald: yes, but let's say we have almost nothing in common with the chinese culturally
[30.12.21 08:32:11] gerald: like with Afghans
[30.12.21 08:32:13] angelo: people are like sheep, they still try to divide into strangers and fellow countrymen
[30.12.21 08:32:21] angelo: of course
[30.12.21 08:32:25] angelo: but that's for now
[12/30/21 08:32:27] gerald: it's in the subcortex of our brain
[12/30/21 08:32:32] gerald: there's no getting away from it
[12/30/221 08:33:12] gerald: those our ancestors who stopped dividing into their own/foreign - simply died out)
[30.12.21 08:33:43] angelo: imagine, that the next stage of mankind evolution - ours are earthlings
[30.12.21 08:33:52] angelo: and the aliens are another species )
[30.12.21 08:34:05] gerald: that would be cool)
[30.12.21 08:34:20] gerald: saw the movie long time ago "Arrival"
[30.12.21 08:34:29] gerald: this branch opens nicely there
[12/30/21 08:34:53] angelo: not a bad movie by the way
[30.12.21 08:35:38] angelo: well, so far we're going to the Meta Universe
[30.12.21 08:36:19] gerald: you think we'll soon be communicating with you in virtual room in meta universe?
[30.12.21 08:36:52] angelo: i tried it )
[30.12.21 08:36:54] angelo: Seems okay.
[30.12.21 08:37:16] angelo: cool, but we're not kids, fantasy and involvement is not the same
[12/30/21 08:37:37] gerald: Yeah, but 20-somethings can get into it in a heartbeat.
[30.12.21 08:37:48] gerald: and they'll get their tic tacs there ahahahah)
[12/30/21 08:38:57] angelo: see, they already have concerts for 10,000 people
[30.12.21 08:39:12] gerald: we'll see.)
[30.12.21 08:39:41] angelo: and then will be on movies
[30.12.21 08:39:45] angelo: johnny mnemonic
[12/30/21 08:39:47] angelo: Nirvana
[12/30/21 08:39:50] angelo: if you've seen these
[30.12.21 08:39:54] gerald: Nope.
[30.12.21 08:40:01] gerald: good ?
[12/30/21 08:40:25] angelo: uh
[12/30/21 08:40:28] angelo: classic !
[12/30/21 08:40:32] angelo: both watching !
[30.12.21 08:40:36] gerald: noted
[12/30/21 08:41:21] angelo: it's as classic as hackers with jolie
[12/30/21 08:41:34] angelo: at 7 years old I thought I was gonna be a hacker :D
[12/30/221 08:41:50] gerald: I had a tape of that movie at home)
[12/30/21 08:42:17] gerald: I thought I was gonna study stars when I was 7\)
[12/30/21 08:43:05] angelo: heh.)
[30.12.21 08:43:13] angelo: we had such gangsterism
[12/30/21 08:43:22] angelo: we had dreams to match
[12/30/21 08:43:57] gerald: ... - so they don't take my hat off on the way to school or my mother will kick me in the ass))
[03.01.22 07:36:57] gerald: !
[03.01.22 07:37:05] gerald: Happy New Year, bro!
[03.01.22 08:02:23] angelo: Happy New Year to you too bro! )
[03.01.22 09:03:53] gerald: excuse me for 15 min
[03.01.22 09:04:12] angelo: ok
[03.01.22 13:58:48] angelo: see you tomorrow
[03.01.22 13:58:54] angelo: think about it tomorrow
[03.01.22 13:59:17] gerald: received sensei. tomorrow at 10
[03.01.22 13:59:31] angelo: no
[03.01.22 13:59:33] angelo: come on, by 11
[03.01.22 13:59:48] angelo: I'll be there by 10 tomorrow and you don't have to
[03.01.22 13:59:51] gerald: ok
[04.01.22 08:27:16] gerald: hi)
[04.01.22 09:45:42] angelo: Hey bro
[04.01.22 09:45:46] angelo: sorry, been busy
[04.01.22 09:45:53] gerald: got it)
[04.01.22 09:46:07] angelo: busy and not busy at the same time )
[05.01.22 08:08:46] angelo: Hey bro!
[05.01.22 08:09:32] gerald: salute!)
[05.01.22 08:09:47] gerald: you watched kazakhstan half the night too?)
[05.01.22 08:10:03] angelo: ahah!)
[05.01.22 08:10:06] angelo: not half the night
[05.01.22 08:10:08] angelo: but I was watching
[05.01.22 08:10:16] angelo: like the Belarusians back then
[05.01.22 08:10:23] gerald: kazaks are beautiful
[05.01.22 08:10:24] angelo: let's see who's got more sense
[05.01.22 08:10:47] angelo: They're better at it than we are
[05.01.22 08:10:54] gerald: yes
[05.01.22 08:16:45] angelo: the government is a group of greedy bastards, they understand only force, alas
[05.01.22 08:17:30] gerald: i'm shocked to see that villagers take the side of the people en masse. although the clan system is much stronger there, but still
[05.01.22 08:18:00] angelo: afraid, I guess, or they themselves were insulted
[05.01.22 08:18:13] angelo: They raise our salaries well, they feed the dogs
[05.01.22 08:18:52] angelo: it's a pity that in Russia and the CIS everything is only through cunts
[05.01.22 08:19:00] gerald: afraid. kazakhs are neither russians nor belarussians. they do not throw snowballs at cars, they stop cars and steal them
[05.01.22 08:19:01] angelo: it does not work like that judging by the history
[05.01.22 08:19:23] angelo: yeah, the blood is hot
[05.01.22 08:19:30] gerald: coaches
[05.01.22 08:19:35] gerald: different mentality
[05.01.22 08:19:48] angelo: kazaks kicked ass without a problem)
[05.01.22 08:20:11] gerald: So the conclusion - Kazakhs can kick ass and rap from the soul)
[05.01.22 08:21:41] angelo: We'll see) You know, you look at neighbors, and we must learn from their mistakes, give them some leeway in laws, correct their own mistakes. No fucking way, we'll look at our neighbors and take better care of the law enforcement agencies, what kind of stupid leaders we have
[05.01.22 08:22:08] gerald: +++
[05.01.22 08:22:20] angelo: power is probably worse than heroin and coke
[05.01.22 08:22:32] gerald: they are not dumb, they were born in 50s. 90% of cotton in their heads
[05.01.22 08:22:46] gerald: + power and money of course
[05.01.22 08:23:04] gerald: For 80 years they were beggars, now they unconsciously try to get even
[05.01.22 08:23:29] angelo: Nazarbayev's family has a total sum of $100 billion of personal funds
[05.01.22 08:23:36] angelo: WHY more?!
[05.01.22 08:23:50] angelo: The government really is eating his balls here
[05.01.22 08:24:00] angelo: There was a cool movie on this subject
[05.01.22 08:24:52] angelo: They did an experiment, a group of people was divided into two. One guards, the other prisoners. It's as simple as two fingers. And then the guards from the authorities (pseudo, chtay actors) went crazy and they became like our FSIN.
[05.01.22 08:25:19] gerald: I saw it last year
[05.01.22 08:25:44] gerald: They did that in the 60's
[05.01.22 08:25:47] angelo: so bro, power is a scary thing. Not everyone will pass through it and remain a normal person.
[05.01.22 08:25:57] angelo: I think there was one
[05.01.22 08:26:02] gerald: that's why they invented changeability
[05.01.22 08:26:38] gerald: any cis citizen - removability? what's the word?
[05.01.22 08:26:44] gerald: :laughing:
[05.01.22 08:27:16] angelo: well yeah, that makes sense. Like an expiration date so he doesn't get fucked up like ours.
[05.01.22 08:27:43] angelo: yeah, look who was born in Ru in 2000, there was Putin, they are 20 years old now and Putin again!)
[05.01.22 08:28:32] gerald: yes, 20 years people live in one era)
[05.01.22 08:29:51] angelo: that's fucked up.)
[05.01.22 08:31:08] angelo: they catch our law enforcers with billions of dollars, they keep it in their pockets, they store it like chinese ministers do. They don't even know what to do with them. This is a disease.
[05.01.22 08:31:43] gerald: sickness is the most appropriate word
[05.01.22 08:31:49] gerald: these people are sick
[05.01.22 08:31:52] gerald: they must be treated
[05.01.22 08:32:21] angelo: who to be cured, and who for the préforme on the pole
[05.01.22 08:32:33] angelo: :smiling_imp:
[05.01.22 08:32:57] gerald: it's a historical tradition)
[05.01.22 08:33:14] gerald: the main thing is that you and I won't end up on the poles in 5 years
[05.01.22 08:33:30] gerald: otherwise, you know, this machine with poles is only worth running
[05.01.22 08:33:34] gerald: and fuck
[05.01.22 08:34:25] angelo: you're right, there's a Russian rebellion
[05.01.22 08:34:29] angelo: first you, then you
[05.01.22 08:34:39] angelo: fuck, how other countries live!)) i don't understand
[05.01.22 08:34:48] gerald: differently)
[05.01.22 08:35:23] gerald: we are far away from norway, but on the other hand it's great that we're russia and not turkmenia
[05.01.22 08:35:39] angelo: that's it, I've seen it
[05.01.22 08:35:52] angelo: that's it, the man's head is gone far away
[05.01.22 08:35:58] gerald: and forever
[05.01.22 08:36:11] gerald: like North Koreans
[05.01.22 08:36:21] gerald: like Russians born in 50's
[05.01.22 08:37:06] angelo: maybe it's all described in psychiatry]
[05.01.22 08:37:14] gerald: +
[05.01.22 08:49:57] angelo: look at the plans in my head : while i'm buying vpc, waiting for our programmers to build our server for crypto, make you an account and will show you how to build crypto
[05.01.22 08:50:01] angelo: Crypto you know what it is?
[05.01.22 08:50:37] gerald: superficially
[05.01.22 08:51:00] angelo: encryption of programs so antivirus will not detect them on startup
[05.01.22 08:51:12] gerald: ah, I see it then)
[05.01.22 08:51:20] angelo: we'll do it too )
[05.01.22 08:51:32] gerald: yeah, new skills!
[05.01.22 08:51:49] gerald: that makes me a little smarter)
[05.01.22 08:52:12] gerald: zensit my become a little smarter :grin
[05.01.22 08:52:12] angelo: well, what will you do )
[05.01.22 08:52:24] angelo: ))))
[05.01.22 08:52:27] angelo: ksttai
[05.01.22 08:52:36] angelo: you watched Borat ?)
[05.01.22 08:52:44] gerald: 1st part only
[05.01.22 08:52:47] gerald: a long time ago
[05.01.22 08:52:51] gerald: they say the 2nd bomb
[05.01.22 08:53:10] angelo: haven't seen the second one by himself
[05.01.22 08:53:15] angelo: but I watched the first one 10 times]
[05.01.22 08:53:50] gerald: I'll give you 5 mn bro
[05.01.22 08:53:58] angelo: +
[05.01.22 10:16:36] gerald: angelo, you also have your own algorithm / sequence of actions in crypto?
[05.01.22 10:21:20] angelo: well, we're not cryptors.
[05.01.22 10:21:24] angelo: very convenient
[05.01.22 10:21:29] angelo: it's as easy as two fingers
[05.01.22 10:21:36] gerald: got it
[05.01.22 10:46:23] angelo: mostly people 40+ sit here
[05.01.22 10:46:26] angelo: 5-+
[05.01.22 10:46:27] angelo: 50
[05.01.22 10:46:40] angelo: It's almost pointless to talk about politics here
[05.01.22 10:46:44] angelo: trust me
[05.01.22 10:46:49] gerald: accepted
[05.01.22 10:47:10] angelo: these are Soviet people
[05.01.22 10:47:17] gerald: Channel 1 seems to be their 24/7 feeds.)
[05.01.22 10:47:24] angelo: well +-
[05.01.22 10:47:27] angelo: or Rent TV
[05.01.22 10:47:54] gerald: obame))
[05.01.22 10:47:57] angelo: there are enemies everywhere, and power is from god roughly speaking
[05.01.22 10:48:30] gerald: a little bit weighed down by the residual sovietness of society
[05.01.22 10:49:44] angelo: Yes, it's amazing the psychology of slaves. We are beaten by our own people and so on by all accounts
[05.01.22 10:50:11] angelo: but when they mention the eu and america, they forget that most of the companies belong to them.)
[05.01.22 10:50:32] angelo: and then their logic is thinking and saying Taxes they pay us...
[05.01.22 10:50:49] angelo: absurd, it is useless to argue with them, their arguments are primitive, because their head is washed
[05.01.22 10:51:44] gerald: washed forever. what the Soviets have done well and for centuries is propaganda
[05.01.22 10:51:59] gerald: half of the world washed up with this heresy on a genetic level
[05.01.22 10:52:49] angelo: But look how well the system works. It is very convenient to live with external enemies.
[05.01.22 10:53:19] gerald: external enemy as the meaning of state existence
[05.01.22 10:53:59] gerald: we must think how to fight back against china in 10 years, while they are still fighting with gays and the internet.
[05.01.22 10:54:02] gerald: Iwpizdoo!)
[05.01.22 10:54:07] gerald: one disappointment
[05.01.22 10:55:11] angelo: you know, I'm always in favor of change. Change gives a chance for the better. A change of job, girlfriend, power. You have a chance to change. Stagnation kills your ambition.
[05.01.22 10:55:34] angelo: stability is a very stupid word
[05.01.22 10:55:58] angelo: it makes you stupid, unambitious and irresponsible
[05.01.22 10:56:24] gerald: i second every word bro
[05.01.22 10:59:17] angelo: great, nice to hear
[05.01.22 11:30:04] gerald: bro, 10 minutes to the store, ok?
[05.01.22 11:37:12] angelo: go ahead
[05.01.22 11:37:14] angelo: I'm running here myself
[06.01.22 08:23:02] angelo: hi !
[06.01.22 08:23:31] gerald: hi !)
[06.01.22 08:23:48] angelo: need VPS bro))

[06.01.22 09:23:25] angelo: basically there are two choices
[06.01.22 09:23:31] gerald: angelo, another thing I wanted to ask, tell me, is it possible to grow here in the future, both in terms of increased responsibilities, and the salary?
[06.01.22 09:23:32] angelo: Asus Toof or Lenovo Legion
[06.01.22 09:23:41] gerald: Lenovo Legion is ok
[06.01.22 09:23:41] angelo: of course

[06.01.22 09:24:21] angelo: clients change tactics
[06.01.22 09:24:42] angelo: I was supporting clients in two directions, and then they put me on a completely different product
[06.01.22 09:25:24] angelo: there is no work for the sake of work, everything is in demand of this or that direction.
[06.01.22 09:25:33] gerald: accepted
[06.01.22 09:26:06] angelo: here VPS became really badly needed when the client began to revive the project and it is in the formative stage, so our forces are thrown at it
[06.01.22 09:26:44] gerald: just like in war)
[06.01.22 09:26:49] gerald: forces are thrown)
[06.01.22 09:26:56] angelo: well +-so]
[06.01.22 09:27:07] angelo: we're partisans of invisible front))
[06.01.22 09:27:34] gerald: encrypting ourselves like ninja in telegram (with))))
[06.01.22 09:27:49] angelo: you and me support, it can be simple UPU setup, testing of some products, crypto and customer support
[06.01.22 09:27:52] angelo: ))
[06.01.22 09:28:21] angelo: we are multifunctional and really needed
[06.01.22 09:29:16] gerald: handymen ahahahah)
[06.01.22 09:29:24] angelo: i used to do a lot of things, sometimes tasks are very boring and monotonous, sometimes interesting, in my case, testing is in my blood, i like to find bugs somewhere
[06.01.22 09:30:05] angelo: handymen, only intellectual labor!
[06.01.22 09:30:13] gerald: that's what I meant
[06.01.22 09:30:49] angelo: here's the UPU, you need to buy, and they give life to bots
[06.01.22 09:31:09] angelo: VPS are blood vessels, that is, bots)
[06.01.22 09:31:19] angelo: oh I compared that !
[06.01.22 09:32:05] angelo: but I think we have a normal wage, in small towns it is certainly easier, because the same 1000 is money
[06.01.22 09:32:33] gerald: he compared poetically)

[10.01.22 09:28:35] angelo: the price is not much different but the speed is approximately 500 Mb/sec and 3000 Mb/sec
[10.01.22 09:28:39] angelo: 6 times faster
[10.01.22 09:30:42] gerald: did your motherboard already have a connector for m2?
[10.01.22 09:30:54] angelo: sure
[10.01.22 09:31:17] angelo: but here's a nuance, sats have 2 times bigger TBW
[10.01.22 09:31:20] angelo: resource
[10.01.22 09:31:36] gerald: hmm
[10.01.22 09:32:39] angelo: I take it
[10.01.22 09:32:46] angelo: data xpg gammix s11 pro
[10.01.22 09:33:11] angelo: but samung 980 pro is considered ideal
[10.01.22 09:33:50] gerald: i wonder - is it possible to integrate ь2 externally into the pc's mother?
[10.01.22 09:33:54] gerald: y2*
[10.01.22 09:33:58] gerald: m2**
[10.01.22 09:34:03] angelo: um
[10.01.22 09:34:11] angelo: it's easier to make it external
[10.01.22 09:34:17] angelo: i think so
[10.01.22 09:34:25] gerald: yes, in principle
[10.01.22 09:34:36] angelo: you buy external box and connect it with SZB 3.1
[10.01.22 09:34:49] angelo: speed like sata
[10.01.22 09:35:13] angelo: but then again, laptop is more convenient
[10.01.22 09:35:14] gerald: i think i know what i got for my birthday present))
[10.01.22 09:35:24] angelo: notebook !
[10.01.22 09:35:25] angelo: )

[10.01.22 09:35:55] gerald: you want to live so much)
[10.01.22 09:36:01] gerald: sorry
[10.01.22 09:36:13] angelo: I built myself a computer in january
[10.01.22 09:36:23] angelo: took me a fuckin' month to choose

[10.01.22 09:36:30] angelo: all light
[10.01.22 09:36:36] angelo: all in harmony - all fucked up
[10.01.22 09:36:40] angelo: just a sweet car
[10.01.22 09:37:02] angelo: and after 2 months i realized i needed a laptop.... the fuck i was selling the computer almost in tears
[10.01.22 09:37:09] gerald: ((
[10.01.22 09:37:20] angelo: i've had a computer for 20 years
[10.01.22 09:37:31] angelo: for me it is an indispensable part of life
[10.01.22 09:37:39] gerald: it's like selling your favorite car
[10.01.22 09:37:45] angelo: sure
[10.01.22 09:38:01] angelo: still not comfortable without system
[10.01.22 09:38:18] angelo: habit deepened in depths of soul and brain
[10.01.22 09:38:56] angelo: liked my laptop as a new friend / brother... But I always want to press the Pauver button on the phone
[10.01.22 09:39:13] gerald: and a speaker sound... yeah
[10.01.22 09:39:40] angelo: yeah, you also remember the dsl modem )
[10.01.22 09:39:44] angelo: and tube monitors
[10.01.22 09:39:46] gerald: ahahahah)
[10.01.22 09:39:59] angelo: look straight to the notebooks
[10.01.22 09:40:16] gerald: how many hours I spent in my childhood at computer clubs with those monitors, ugh)
[10.01.22 09:40:24] angelo: yeah
[10.01.22 09:40:36] angelo: moniker+systemnik is closer than broads to us
[10.01.22 09:40:45] gerald: fact
[10.01.22 09:40:54] gerald: no, anyway, this year we should take a laptop
[10.01.22 09:41:33] gerald: at least gtx 750 and 16 bit of RAM
[10.01.22 09:42:08] gerald: I haven't looked for iron in new laptops for a long time
[10.01.22 09:42:15] angelo: 3050
[10.01.22 09:42:21] angelo: that's minimum
[10.01.22 09:42:24] angelo: price from 60 exactly
[10.01.22 09:42:31] angelo: I've been monitoring this market for a year
[10.01.22 09:42:53] gerald: take it in installments and ok
[10.01.22 09:43:16] angelo: I borrowed from two friends]
[10.01.22 09:43:37] gerald: horizontal social connections are our thing)
[10.01.22 09:43:42] angelo: )))
[10.01.22 09:43:50] angelo: well, i sold the computer later and gave the money back

[10.01.22 09:48:24] gerald: that's normal.
[10.01.22 09:48:31] angelo: yeah
[10.01.22 09:48:42] angelo: I got mine for 70, and then it went back to 90
[10.01.22 09:49:03] angelo: now he added memory/hards - it's 110-120

[10.01.22 09:49:33] angelo: yes
[10.01.22 09:49:37] gerald: ok
[10.01.22 09:49:43] angelo: see models
[10.01.22 09:49:52] angelo: but they have memory and harddisplacement
[10.01.22 09:50:00] angelo: you can even change the paste

[10.01.22 09:51:20] angelo: no, thanks for the crown]
[10.01.22 09:51:26] angelo: just a cold
[10.01.22 09:51:47] angelo: nothing like that, but not nice
[10.01.22 09:51:48] gerald: )
[10.01.22 09:51:59] gerald: yes, especially in winter
[10.01.22 09:52:14] gerald: outside in the shop like in Skyrim on the mountain
[10.01.22 09:53:02] angelo: ahaha
[10.01.22 09:53:03] angelo: yeah
[10.01.22 09:53:12] angelo: and I also get up at 7 am
[10.01.22 09:53:23] angelo: that's fucked up
[10.01.22 09:53:49] gerald: also these fuckin' dreams when you're sick
[10.01.22 09:54:07] gerald: i dreamt today that the trash kicked me for a joint and wanted to shut me down for 2 years
[10.01.22 09:54:15] gerald: and i've been fucking clean since january
[10.01.22 09:54:46] angelo: shit, at 3 a.m. i was watching videos of guys/girls taking couriers for 228
[10.01.22 09:55:04] gerald: and woke up at 7 am for work)
[10.01.22 09:55:06] angelo: what an interesting night we have today )
[10.01.22 09:55:11] gerald: yeah, it's fucking scary
[10.01.22 09:55:31] angelo: yeah, there's a girl, 19 years old, we wanted to get married...gone for 9 years
[10.01.22 09:55:46] gerald: and also these videos where they break legs/hands and pussyfoot youths who tried to ditch the store
[10.01.22 09:56:14] gerald: classic
[10.01.22 09:56:31] gerald: ouch
[10.01.22 09:56:46] angelo: seen it
[10.01.22 09:56:55] angelo: and most importantly the same message everywhere
[10.01.22 09:57:00] angelo: for others to think
[10.01.22 09:57:10] angelo: who the fuck would think at 16-20?!
[10.01.22 09:57:14] angelo: bullshit
[10.01.22 09:57:19] angelo: always think i have the most
[10.01.22 09:57:22] gerald: sure, they're kids
[10.01.22 09:57:33] gerald: maximalism, easy money, etc.
[10.01.22 09:57:36] angelo: consequently punitive measure makes no sense
[10.01.22 09:57:58] gerald: Punitators just work off their dough
[10.01.22 09:58:06] angelo: sorry bro
[10.01.22 09:58:16] gerald: absolutely
[10.01.22 09:58:18] angelo: more than half now it's article 228
[10.01.22 09:58:26] gerald: popular article
[10.01.22 09:58:47] angelo: I am loyal to the mistakes of youth, I am not without sin to throw stones myself
[10.01.22 09:59:27] gerald: i had a friend of mine who got out of jail a few years ago, he told me: they release me, a bus pulls up, young people come out and they're all 18-19 years old. 90% 228
[10.01.22 09:59:48] gerald: yes, you cannot be locked up for crimes that are not related to violence against others
[10.01.22 10:00:04] gerald: Well, the FSIN is a separate business
[10.01.22 10:00:44] gerald: And it looks like there will be no other way
[10.01.22 10:00:52] angelo: guess how much will it cost and what will happen afterwards?!
[10.01.22 10:01:12] gerald: statistically, one third will go back to jail
[10.01.22 10:01:28] angelo: a lot of problems will come out
[10.01.22 10:01:35] angelo: and a demographic pit like after 90s
[10.01.22 10:01:44] gerald: if not worse
[10.01.22 10:01:51] angelo: you can do five years for a couple of grams
[10.01.22 10:02:05] angelo: I can't understand it
[10.01.22 10:02:25] gerald: You can go without anything, you just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
[10.01.22 10:02:32] gerald: and went for two
[10.01.22 10:02:40] angelo: that's a separate fucking story
[10.01.22 10:02:40] gerald: especially in the south of the country it's common
[10.01.22 10:03:01] gerald: it's all scary
[10.01.22 10:03:28] angelo: I am chatting with people from 10K towns. I asked them what you do on weekends? There's nothing to do, there's nothing but Red and White.
[10.01.22 10:03:58] gerald: Well, either to the woods with mushrooms, or for alcohol
[10.01.22 10:04:03] angelo: they themselves create conditions for the youth, actually nothing new
[10.01.22 10:04:18] angelo: young people have no luck in Russia
[10.01.22 10:04:24] angelo: Since 90s
[10.01.22 10:04:31] gerald: since 1917
[10.01.22 10:04:37] angelo: well, yes
[10.01.22 10:04:41] angelo: deeper
[10.01.22 10:04:46] angelo: I was talking to a guy here
[10.01.22 10:04:50] angelo: 15 friends in the picture
[10.01.22 10:05:00] angelo: he was born in '88
[10.01.22 10:05:19] angelo: alive (and free) says me and my friend
[10.01.22 10:05:23] angelo: out of 15 people 0_0
[10.01.22 10:05:34] gerald: all of russia
[10.01.22 10:05:39] gerald: fuck
[10.01.22 10:05:54] angelo: at least they were smart enough to ban AUE
[10.01.22 10:05:56] gerald: americans, take us over please
[10.01.22 10:06:00] angelo: ))))
[10.01.22 10:06:02] angelo: yes yes
[10.01.22 10:06:13] angelo: or we'll bury ourselves
[10.01.22 10:06:33] angelo: I'm in close contact with the youth
[10.01.22 10:06:58] gerald: the fact is, russia does not need to be conquered, you just have to let it fail its own people, and it will fall apart by itself.
[10.01.22 10:07:16] angelo: it's hard for them when you have a great life in social networks and you eat dick with butter
[10.01.22 10:07:31] angelo: there, very right words
[10.01.22 10:07:36] angelo: we don't need an enemy
[10.01.22 10:07:45] angelo: we're doing fine here without him
[10.01.22 10:07:47] gerald: all enemies are in the kremlin
[10.01.22 10:08:06] angelo: better not to write such things in general chat room ))
[10.01.22 10:08:13] gerald: i got it already)
[10.01.22 10:08:21] gerald: I'm just sharing my thoughts with you)
[10.01.22 10:08:39] angelo: similarly
[10.01.22 10:08:52] gerald: and in general I won't enter into discussions anymore. if there are people 40+ so the point
[10.01.22 10:08:53] angelo: anyway, to pass the youth it's a cunt's luck
[10.01.22 10:09:11] angelo: well, i tried at first, but i realized - it's no use
[10.01.22 10:09:22] angelo: and our bosses are grown-ups
[10.01.22 10:09:27] gerald: any man in russia is an accidental surviving boy who also managed to avoid prison
[10.01.22 10:09:51] angelo: I was just watching the video yesterday
[10.01.22 10:10:00] angelo: and it was scary to remember his 18 years
[10.01.22 10:10:11] angelo: it was so fucking hard
[10.01.22 10:10:58] angelo: but think about it - you like anime, you know languages, you're so young and progressive... And you live somewhere beyond the Urals...
[10.01.22 10:11:15] angelo: where it's still better not to go to the neighboring district
[10.01.22 10:11:47] gerald: bro I spent 18 years of my life like that, but not beyond the Urals, but beyond - beyond kazakhstan
[10.01.22 10:12:12] angelo: for us it was normal to wear skins and sneakers, now kids are called "non-Russian," even though they are civilized kids.
[10.01.22 10:12:47] angelo: Well, you and I know the Russian norm for sad people
[10.01.22 10:13:37] angelo: I'd tear those kids apart myself
[10.01.22 10:13:49] gerald: +++
[10.01.22 10:14:19] gerald: I got Vietnamese flashbacks in my head
[10.01.22 10:15:11] gerald: When I moved to a big city and realized I don't have to constantly carry knife with me, it became so easy
[10.01.22 10:15:47] gerald: you didn't think about emigration?
[10.01.22 10:17:46] angelo: I carry a gas can
[10.01.22 10:17:51] angelo: of course i did
[10.01.22 10:17:59] angelo: I went to live in asia and europe
[10.01.22 10:18:26] angelo: and after I arrived I got dipresniac
[10.01.22 10:18:41] angelo: I'm sick of drab masses of my country
[10.01.22 10:19:06] gerald: you never felt like you were going back to the rf?
[10.01.22 10:19:26] angelo: ))) sure it happened, it seemed to live in russia
[10.01.22 10:19:30] gerald: +++
[10.01.22 10:19:46] angelo: nostalgia is a noose of Russian people
[10.01.22 10:20:07] angelo: which we especially like to put on when we're drunk and tighten
[10.01.22 10:20:52] gerald: and we're usually nostalgic for something which never happened
[10.01.22 10:21:01] gerald: we are very strange people)
[10.01.22 10:21:02] angelo: oh yes
[10.01.22 10:21:04] angelo: she idealizes everything
[10.01.22 10:21:11] angelo: it's fucking amazing
[10.01.22 10:21:17] angelo: we can never live in the present
[10.01.22 10:22:48] angelo: two things get on my nerves here: permanently ugly faces (we can't rejoice) and shitty attitude towards others when there's no need (until your neighbor buys a new car or your neighbor puts on a bright colored skirt or makes a door
[10.01.22 10:23:05] angelo: dreadlocks
[10.01.22 10:25:39] gerald: and it's so deep in our dna. no, don't think that i blame our people, i love them in my own way (considering that i grew up as a national minority in my childhood). but the demographics speaks for itself - the average russian is a 45+ woman
that is the cashier at the five-store. and these are mentally infinitely distant people from the same 30-somethings.
[10.01.22 10:26:09] gerald: although if you and i go to britain or germany - we'll be looked at a bit like oriental savages).
[10.01.22 10:26:52] gerald: i have family in germany
[10.01.22 10:27:03] gerald: keep in touch
[10.01.22 10:27:31] gerald: and you know what - it's our national sport to cheat with taxes, etc.)
[10.01.22 10:27:56] gerald: as if our brain works like that by default
[10.01.22 10:29:35] angelo: Yes, I myself have peretenzii to my people... All my life I have been "fighting" for my self and the freedom of my choice. By the way I also have relatives scattered around the EU countries
[10.01.22 10:29:48] angelo: fuck it) invent your own nation, change your last name
[10.01.22 10:29:50] angelo: don't sweat it
[10.01.22 10:29:59] angelo: let's just say I'm not exactly russian myself
[10.01.22 10:30:12] gerald: there are no Russians at all()
[10.01.22 10:30:14] gerald: )
[10.01.22 10:30:34] gerald: I choose my nation - "kajit" :grin:
[10.01.22 10:31:43] angelo: they confuse me with an Albanian ))
[10.01.22 10:31:53] angelo: but Albanians are taken for my nation everywhere
[10.01.22 10:32:05] angelo: Albanian/Greek
[10.01.22 10:32:48] gerald: very good)
[10.01.22 10:33:16] angelo: aha)))) so I think there will be no problem
[10.01.22 10:33:22] angelo: I remember you said you were russian
[10.01.22 10:33:27] angelo: Fucking attitude changed
[10.01.22 10:33:37] angelo: at 16 it would have been funny
[10.01.22 10:33:41] angelo: even proud !
[10.01.22 10:34:04] angelo: but when you're not an asshole, it's not so funny, when your family is looked at as gopniks and feared
[10.01.22 10:34:16] angelo: and it happened everywhere
[10.01.22 10:36:07] gerald: I have always given a shit, but there is one trigger that pours blood in my eyes and wants to take an axe and start chopping, like our ancestors did - when people from the Caucasus begin to shout on the street - like you Russian devils, you have no spirit, you pigs
[10.01.22 10:36:22] gerald: Here all stoppages and tolerance come off
[10.01.22 10:36:46] angelo: ouch
[10.01.22 10:36:54] angelo: you're here, you got into my soul.)
[10.01.22 10:36:59] angelo: i am also very calm
[10.01.22 10:37:00] angelo: to nations

[12.01.22 07:50:15] gerald: and in the evenings campfire, campfire supper and hot tea on fire. the tale
[12.01.22 07:50:33] angelo: aha!!! that's the theme in the 21 st century!)
[12.01.22 07:50:37] angelo: when everyone is so fucked up
[12.01.22 07:51:28] gerald: yeah) the main thing is to take a normal tent
[12.01.22 07:51:50] angelo: there was a time I slept in the woods
[12.01.22 07:51:55] angelo: without tent ))
[12.01.22 07:52:12] gerald: you slept in a sleeping bag?

[12.01.22 07:53:32] angelo: we were running in underwear in zero, wet, across the lakes
[12.01.22 07:53:37] angelo: it was fucked up
[12.01.22 07:54:02] angelo: but now, if you walk, even Godzilla will pass by - don't give a fuck!)
[12.01.22 07:54:27] gerald: we are russians, god is with us))
[12.01.22 07:54:42] angelo: sometimes i think that we are afraid of ourselves because we have a fucked up attitude
[12.01.22 07:54:57] gerald: good hypothesis
[12.01.22 07:55:18] angelo: where others run away, we say - Fuck you!
[12.01.22 07:55:43] angelo: this is a magic phrase which brought many stories into our life ))
[12.01.22 07:56:06] gerald: don't worry, I've done it a hundred times (c)
[12.01.22 07:56:10] gerald: quotes of great men)
[12.01.22 07:58:20] angelo: yes yes yes ))
[12.01.22 07:59:07] angelo: I had an electrician come in, he wanted to cut the wire of a light bulb, I said to him - man, the wire is energized! He said, "Oh, come on, I'm an electrician, there's nothing there.
[12.01.22 07:59:10] angelo: And how
[12.01.22 07:59:11] angelo: BLEEP!
[12.01.22 07:59:28] angelo: it's a pity the wire cutters were rubberized, the man got no experience
[12.01.22 08:00:53] angelo: but the message was exactly - I did it a hundred times)
[12.01.22 08:01:51] gerald: my father was handy and in the noughties, when he couldn't even pay the electricity bill, he would just switch to another phase in the meter and drop it on the neighbors. i used to watch this a lot and when i was 13 i came home from school, turned on a cartoon, but the electrician came and cut the power. i thought - fuck it, i've seen the boss do this a hundred times. as you know, at the end it was also a BLEEP)
[12.01.22 08:02:36] angelo: both funny and sad, though
[12.01.22 08:02:39] angelo: but alive
[12.01.22 08:03:29] gerald: that's true) but I never learned how to do electrics.
[12.01.22 08:03:58] gerald: although half of the outlets in the apartment stopped working somehow.
[12.01.22 08:04:20] angelo: everything is simple there )) i have done it a hundred times ))
[12.01.22 08:04:24] gerald: ))
[12.01.22 08:04:29] angelo: help from youtube, I'm using it myself.
[12.01.22 08:06:10] angelo: your wiring is just aluminum, old, it's fucked up, I suffered it myself
[12.01.22 08:06:39] gerald: so it's gotta be replaced, right?
[12.01.22 08:06:50] gerald: Do you have to trench the walls in such cases?
[12.01.22 08:07:16] angelo: yeah]
[12.01.22 08:07:20] angelo: very fascinating process
[12.01.22 08:07:23] gerald: fuck!
[12.01.22 08:07:32] angelo: ideally
[12.01.22 08:07:48] gerald: still wanted to fuck up the repair
[12.01.22 08:08:13] angelo: it sounds scary, in fact it's just like shoving wires into the wall
[12.01.22 09:27:31] angelo: will there be time for the wps?

[12.01.22 15:25:49] angelo: wait
[12.01.22 15:25:57] angelo: too complicated
[12.01.22 15:26:09] angelo: look for where you have path to VW Virtualka
[12.01.22 15:26:15] angelo: you can specify any
[12.01.22 15:26:33] angelo: find where they are and just copy/transfer them to a second hard drive

[12.01.22 15:27:47] angelo: not the program itself
[12.01.22 15:27:50] gerald: the cars are on D
[12.01.22 15:27:56] angelo: well
[12.01.22 15:28:00] gerald: the program itself is installed on C

[12.01.22 15:28:14] angelo: their files
[12.01.22 15:28:16] gerald: hmm
[12.01.22 15:28:18] angelo: they are on D
[12.01.22 15:28:22] gerald: they all are on D
[12.01.22 15:28:43] angelo: export most likely made to C
[12.01.22 15:28:49] gerald: not
[12.01.22 15:28:50] gerald: on D
[12.01.22 15:28:51] angelo: you can put this file to D too
[12.01.22 15:28:54] angelo: hmm

[18.01.22 14:25:53] angelo: I have no more strength to be within these walls...
The night beckons with secrets, howls with sirens...
Children of the urban under the dome of the sky...
Looking at the stars, believing in things that never were...
No more fear, no more pain!
In those moments it was as if I was closer to God...
And someone was leading me by the hand Through the city
With lanterns lighting the way...
Electric impulses, lights,
The labyrinths of Babylon, smoke in puffs...
We wonder... where the ships go...
