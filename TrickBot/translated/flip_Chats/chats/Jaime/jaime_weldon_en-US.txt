[16.11.21 06:50:43] jaime: No, he didn't. Frans got sick with the crown.
[16.11.21 06:50:59] jaime: But I think he'll figure it out.
[16.11.21 06:51:37] jaime: Are you all right?
[16.11.21 06:51:37] weldon: Oh, man, I thought I was the only one sick)
[16.11.21 06:52:07] weldon: no way, my whole body hurts(
[16.11.21 06:52:48] jaime: It's been a while. You take anything?
[16.11.21 06:53:04] weldon: I don't know what to take, vodka with pepper and honey or something
[16.11.21 06:53:52] jaime: I tried it, but without honey.
[16.11.21 06:54:25] weldon: did you get over it?

[16.11.21 06:55:45] jaime: 60% failure rate was
[16.11.21 06:56:40] weldon: we're screwed with hospitals
[16.11.21 06:56:46] jaime: but I was breathing normally, I was weak
[16.11.21 06:57:43] weldon: a free paper came recently "our hospital will live")
[11/16/21 06:58:17] jaime: great title! :)
[16.11.21 06:58:58] weldon: yeah, I thought Kharlamov wrote or stitched)
[11/16/21 21 06:59:12] jaime: I wanted to ask you if you mine raptoreum on CPU? I thought you had a R9 there.
[16.11.21 06:59:50] weldon: Nope, not mining now
[16.11.21 07:00:50] weldon: one FF build - all 24 cores at 100%, I feel sorry for my video
[16.11.21 07:01:46] jaime: He just mines on CPU on Ryzen
[16.11.21 07:02:08] jaime: They promise up to 300 rubles per day

[16.11.21 07:03:30] weldon: `https://www.kryptex.org/` was mining here
[11/16/21 07:06:13] jaime: My CPU goes over 90 degrees, too bad!
[16.11.21 07:07:15] weldon: you haven't installed hwinfo64? you can set alerts for overheating there
[16.11.21 07:08:37] weldon: i had an sdc (with system/window) under 85 when i was building ff in summer
[16.11.21 07:09:10] weldon: had to change to slow sdd
[11/16/21/17:12:51] jaime: my main CPU had lm_sensor there, AMD had 100 degree stop. :) but i don't know.
[16.11.21 07:13:19] weldon: so what kind of CPU do you have? fx ?
[16.11.21 07:14:20] jaime: Ryzen R9 3600 without X at 65 TDP
[16.11.21 07:15:14] jaime: AMD Ryzen 9 3900
[16.11.21 07:15:19] jaime: More exactly
[16.11.21 07:18:30] weldon: p9 3900 I have too, about 100 watt
[16.11.21 07:20:05] jaime: I got it from Chinese! :)
[16.11.21 07:20:43] weldon: ) now you think the Koreans are doing something
[16.11.21 07:21:53] jaime: on alike, boo :)
[16.11.21 07:24:52] weldon: Muckrakers from jail call again) they are soaking up the dough.
[16.11.21 07:25:55] weldon: haven't rattled for a while
[16.11.21 07:27:14] jaime: They never called me. That's a shame.
[16.11.21 07:28:36] weldon: I called back once (bugged) - they charged me about 30 rubles for 25 seconds
[16.11.21 07:37:07] jaime: oh good rates! :)
[22.11.21 10:19:05] weldon: hi
[22.11.21 10:19:15] weldon: got a minute?
[22.11.21 10:19:35] jaime: hi!
[11/22/21 10:19:41] jaime: sure! :)
[22.11.21 10:23:20] weldon: can't get into the git
[22.11.21 10:23:47] jaime: so can he? :)
[22.11.21 10:23:50] jaime: Let me see

[22.11.21 10:26:33] jaime: git branch -a
[22.11.21 10:26:44] weldon: is this before push?
[22.11.21 10:27:02] jaime: look are you in the wizard?
[22.11.21 10:27:23] jaime: just a list of branches.
[22.11.21 10:28:47] jaime: you can try git fetch
[22.11.21 10:28:56] jaime: then git checkout master
[22.11.21 10:29:10] jaime: then git add *
[22.11.21 10:29:39] jaime: commit well and push
[22.11.21 10:30:11] weldon: but what if the commit already did?
[22.11.21 10:30:35] jaime: whatever
[22.11.21 10:30:46] jaime: it is local on the branch
[22.11.21 10:32:34] jaime: what did git branch -a output ?
[22.11.21 10:37:29] weldon: nada !
[22.11.21 10:37:43] weldon: drag and drop moved)
[22.11.21 10:38:18] weldon: git branch -a said
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
[22.11.21 10:39:06] weldon: in general, patches with all sorts of
Only in NIGHTLY_68_END/.cargo: .gitignore
Only in SB: .curr_mozconfig_win
can you do that???
[11/22/11/21 10:43:07] jaime: I don't know.
[11/22/221 10:44:33] jaime: did you clone patches and add something there? In theory, everything was already there add
[22.11.21 10:47:39] weldon: the repository is new,
I created it and put a test file in it from the snb face of tor-browser,
I pulled it to myself with a command - it pulled fine,
Then I put a patch file in a local folder,
Next:
git add *
git commit -a -m "1 commit"
git push origin master and that fucked up...
[22.11.21 10:49:10] jaime: well, i did the same thing :)
[22.11.21 10:49:35] jaime: after fetch didn't help?
[22.11.21 10:51:05] weldon: he had the same reaction as to push
[22.11.21 10:52:26] jaime: maybe git add * added something extra?
[22.11.21 10:59:41] weldon: nothing superfluous there) 1 file patch)))
[22.11.21 11:00:32] weldon: on push, on fetch:

fatal: Authentication failed for
[22.11.21 11:00:48] weldon: remind me who's on git?
[22.11.21 11:01:36] weldon: i cloned drag & drop, and cloned it again - everything came fine, but i can't clone it myself!
[22.11.21 11:17:20] jaime: something with rights
[22.11.21 11:17:30] jaime: are you a project developer?
[22.11.21 11:17:50] weldon: maynfycth
[22.11.21 11:18:00] weldon: mantancer
[22.11.21 11:24:08] jaime: then you're out of versions! :)
[22.11.21 11:24:56] weldon: i'm a Maintainer, not a wunderkind, maybe that's why i created it today
[22.11.21 11:28:56] jaime: And if you created it, why not an owner?
[22.11.21 11:29:15] weldon: well, dunno) like the owner)
[22.11.21 11:30:29] jaime: looked, Maintainer can puchase
[22.11.21 11:30:59] weldon: yeah, in another rep - I'll check it now
[22.11.21 14:02:40] weldon: finally got it)
[22.11.21 14:24:25] jaime: What happened?
[22.11.21 14:25:49] weldon: ctrl+V does not work when entering your password)
[22.11.21 14:26:29] weldon: I used to right-button paste it from the boosters (I forgot it completely))
[22.11.21 14:27:49] weldon: already started with other repo, then I remembered
[22.11.21 14:28:19] jaime: wow! :)
[22.11.21 14:28:28] jaime: I will have to remember
[22.11.21 14:29:00] jaime: I usually use ctrl-ins, shft-ins though.
[22.11.21 14:29:59] weldon: I'll have to try it)
[22.11.21 14:30:14] weldon: and you didn't know about right button?
[22.11.21 14:30:57] jaime: about passwords no! :) about the paste knew!
[22.11.21 14:31:14] jaime: but it's a matter of habit
[22.11.21 14:31:21] weldon: Yeah.
[22.11.21 14:31:51] jaime: on mac I can't switch to ctrl-c(v), no insert
[22.11.21 14:32:44] weldon: at least I learned guitar commands.
[22.11.21 14:35:15] jaime: I think not, at least I do not know. On my local repo, for all sorts of garbage, I handed out permissions through as usual in linux. I created a group for the project and set folder permissions for it, and i used ssh to deal with it.
[22.11.21 14:36:17] jaime: but it was long ago, everything could have been changed, or I did it through the ass. :)
[22.11.21 14:37:26] jaime: Valve on video card screams like a locomotive, my table shakes when revs drop.
[22.11.21 14:37:52] weldon: what do you mine now?
[22.11.21 14:39:45] jaime: I wanted to mine everything on the air until payday. And raptoreum decided to try
[22.11.21 14:40:09] jaime: My meter is broken, I pay by the average
[22.11.21 14:40:22] weldon: sisters with my husband came, my husband said that his friend on a self-assembled farm of 6 vidyas makes 50-60 Krubs, electricity costs 1.5 Krubs ... Is this even possible on the air?
[22.11.21 14:42:43] jaime: i doubt it, the hash rate dropped drastically. On 2080 you can probably make $3 a day.
[22.11.21 14:43:12] jaime: 6*3=18*30=540$
[22.11.21 14:43:14] weldon: 2 nvidia 1000 series, 2 nvidia 2000 series and 2 nvidia 3000 series, all castrates 192 bit
[22.11.21 14:46:34] jaime: 1000 must be $1 each! :)
[22.11.21 14:46:36] weldon: is it on CPU?
[22.11.21 14:47:05] jaime: Yep.
[22.11.21 14:47:36] weldon: are you going to build your own CPU server?
[22.11.21 14:48:24] jaime: No way! :) at night on his pomainu!
[22.11.21 14:49:37] weldon: frequency is not important for cpu_mining
[22.11.21 14:50:06] weldon: it is volume/size of L3 that matters
[22.11.21 14:53:10] weldon: what is Innosilicon ??:face_with_monocle:
[22.11.21 14:53:51] weldon: current market price is 1555743.74 ₽.
[22.11.21 14:54:59] weldon: 720.0 Mh/s over the air...
[22.11.21 14:55:01] jaime: I don't know. Haven't seen such coin.
[22.11.21 14:55:13] weldon: it's a vidya
[11/22/221 14:55:40] weldon: Innosilicon A10 7GB was released on September 20, 2019 with an average power consumption of 1300.0W. The current market price is 1555743.74 ₽.
[11/22/221 14:57:05] jaime: How much? :)
[22.11.21 14:59:16] weldon: `https://www.kryptex.org/ru/best-gpus-for-mining`
[22.11.21 14:59:46] weldon: it's been a long time since I came here.)
[22.11.21 15:07:16] jaime: What do you think about bitcoin?
[22.11.21 15:11:18] weldon: I don't even know...
in the end, among the end, it will find the end at the end:rofl:
[22.11.21 15:13:22] jaime: :)
[23.11.21 11:28:32] weldon: hello
[23.11.21 11:29:22] weldon: overnight I left the PC to mine ether and randomX (procesor) - 150 rubles or so...
[11.23.21 13:02:46] jaime: hi!
[11/23/221 13:02:50] jaime: is it overnight?
[11/23/11/21 13:02:57]
[11/23/221 13:03:09] jaime: Not bad then.
[11/23/221 13:03:19] jaime: I'm having fun with the fan.
[11/23/221 13:03:39] jaime: Lubrication didn't help, I guess the bearing is dead
[11/23/221 13:03:43] weldon: I don't know how much electricity he burned up
[11/23/221 13:04:03] jaime: My videoadoad draws 120 watts
[11/23/221 13:04:21] weldon: mine is 180

[23.11.21 13:06:56] jaime: That's it.
[11/23/221 13:07:09] jaime: I took less than 20, and I was choking on my greed
[11/23/221 13:07:20] jaime: But I got away! :)
[11/23/221 13:09:08] weldon: I took RX 5700 8Gb 256bit last spring for 24 too, I was greedy, I said, I thought I'll try to mine it, or save it for gaming anyway)
[23.11.21 13:09:18] weldon: now you wish I had two
[23.11.21 13:10:09] jaime: you could have just sold it, even without mining, it would have been a good profit!
[11/23/221 13:10:45] weldon: no, maybe I'll have time to play, New Year is coming soon)
[11/23/221 13:12:03] jaime: `` I'm not going to play.

[11/23/221 13:49:55] weldon: not likely (I think yours will say 90% "turn it off")))) there's no mat, plenty of very offensive scenes
[11/23/11/21 13:50:10] weldon: but the plot is awesome
[23.11.21 13:51:37] weldon: it's cool how the hacker invented to pack the drugs and identify them by QR codes
[11/23/221 13:52:58] weldon: all in all it takes 4 hours + "the movie about the movie"

[11/23/221 14:12:54] jaime: Mine doesn't drink champagne, only dry wine.
[11/23/221 14:13:29] weldon: Nah, I'm a rational guy, I don't throw all that "crap" away.)
[11/23/221 14:14:15] jaime: we rode at a wedding, I don't want to ride anymore, it's too much trouble
[11/23/11/21/14:14:49]
[23.11.21 14:15:13] weldon: or bang?))
[23.11.21 14:18:12] jaime: drinking and driving, didn't come to the third :)
[23.11.21 14:18:57] jaime: I had a witness, he pissed from the Palace Bridge
[11/23/221 14:19:12] jaime: My wife can't forget
[11/23/221 14:19:23] weldon: :grin:
[11/23/221 14:19:27] jaime: Good not taken
[11/23/221 14:20:39] weldon: we had a wedding without such "harlami"
[23.11.21 14:26:37] jaime: now he's a respectable guy, head of sector at KB :)
[23.11.21 14:27:35] weldon: KGB head of sector :astonished: )
[23.11.21 14:29:32] jaime: Design Bureau! :)
[11/23/221 14:30:36] weldon: man, I really thought that "Red and White" :rofl:
[23.11.21 14:34:28] weldon: got married, though?)
[11/23/221 14:36:01] jaime: yes, but that's another story! :)
[11/23/221 14:39:22] weldon: our witness stayed overnight with his girlfriend) is also a separate story, covered with mysteries)
[23.11.21 14:40:40] jaime: After the Palace, he had no chance! :)
[24.11.21 12:58:04] weldon: hi

[24.11.21 13:03:22] jaime: And I don't want to.
[24.11.21 13:04:44]
[24.11.21 13:05:55] weldon: But really, someone told me she had a crazy woman and was sent to a mental hospital
[24.11.21 13:08:07] jaime: my uncle's wife threw herself at doctors in a mental hospital, now she's in a hard dipresence, doesn't want to see anyone, even her daughter. Sits alone in her dacha.
[24.11.21 13:08:22] jaime: It's been a year since the covid
[11/24/1921 13:08:35] weldon: That's rough.
[24.11.21 13:10:36] weldon: so is it after the covid shot? or the covid itself?
[24.11.21 13:10:57] jaime: after covid itself
[24.11.21 13:11:48] jaime: I have not heard, but people feel very bad after vaccination, and still get sick. I do not see the point in it.
[04.12.21 08:32:07] jaime: Hi! :)
[04.12.21 17:08:31] weldon: hi.
[04.12.21 17:09:07] weldon: how did you find your SD card?

[04.12.21 17:09:54] weldon: Victoria536
[05.12.21 10:05:18] jaime: hi!
[06.12.21 08:01:24] weldon: hello
[06.12.21 08:01:35] weldon: what were we talking about?
[06.12.21 08:03:09] jaime: Hi!
[06.12.21 08:03:40] jaime: I had a question, strange behavior.
[06.12.21 08:05:15] weldon: s++ ?
[06.12.21 08:07:45] weldon: About SSD there are many good programs, I make a clone of SSD->SSD2 - very useful
[06.12.21 08:08:56] jaime: yeah with ++
[06.12.21 08:09:31] jaime: Yes it's a friend's computer is getting dull. There ssd on 60gb, 700000 hours.
[06.12.21 08:12:14] weldon: 60Gb hmm, really ancient flash drive)
[08.12.21 07:55:58] weldon: hello
[08.12.21 07:58:18] weldon: did you ever use wol?
[08.12.21 08:09:49] jaime: hi!
[08.12.21 08:09:53] jaime: No, what is it?
[08.12.21 08:10:49] weldon: wake on lan like, i want to try pc1 to learn how to wake on network)
[08.12.21 08:11:26] weldon: tried it?
[08.12.21 08:14:36] jaime: I don't. I never turn it off. :)
[08 12/21/221 08:14:50] jaime: But I read it. I think it's not so hard.
[08.12.21 08:16:05] jaime: Should I send a package?
[08.12.21 08:16:14] weldon: kinda) I had to install vin7 from dvd in the morning - haven't done it in 5 years)
[08.12.21 08:16:37] weldon: yeah, magic package on external ip
[08.12.21 08:17:59] jaime: you have to configure your router to forward the packet
[08.12.21 08:18:30] weldon: yeah
[08.12.21 08:20:08] jaime: 9 UDP as I see it
[08.12.21 08:20:15] jaime: where did you get DVD? :)
[08.12.21 08:21:17] weldon: my PC2 crashed in the morning after exiting bios and said, "something wrong with your bios... let me fix your bios" and restored)
[12/12/21 08:22:22] weldon: and i used to hand-correct the bios on PC2 (the old one with DVD) so i could load the system from the cdx
[08.12.21 08:22:29] jaime: :) Just thinking of reflashing it the other day!
[08.12.21 08:23:27] jaime: Oh great, never worked with BIOS before
[08.12.21 08:23:33] weldon: well, I restored it... and i lost booting from sdsd)))) and nothing at hand, except vindex7x64
[08.12.21 08:26:40] jaime: having fun? Maybe it was more convenient to boot HDD and then load everything else through grub?
[08.12.21 08:26:56] jaime: via ramp
[08.12.21 08:27:53] weldon: dunno not use grub
[08.12.21 08:31:52] weldon: i think i ordered nVMe SSD on the net in 19 and the m2 ))))) not even had a look, so i had to buy adapter, wind 10 saw it, but not the bios, found the manual how to patch it, to start with the SSD - ok
[08.12.21 08:33:00] jaime: Did it reset?
[08.12.21 08:33:29] weldon: What do you mean?
[08.12.21 08:33:51] jaime: bios and forgot how to boot?
[08.12.21 08:34:23] weldon: no, i've been working for 2 years and forgot even... maybe got out of bios incorrectly
[08.12.21 08:34:37] jaime: How did you patched bios, is there checksums and stuff?
[08.12.21 08:35:46] weldon: in my bios (as I remember) there are blank blocks, you have to use them
[08.12.21 08:36:33] weldon: i loaded vin7, found a patched bios and poured it on a flash and everything is ok)
[08.12.21 08:40:44] weldon: do you remember in '99 there was a virus - the killer of bios?)
[12/12/21 08:41:14] jaime: I remember it. :) didn't really catch it.
[12.08.21 08:41:21] weldon: those were the days)
[08.12.21 08:42:30] weldon: I think it was called kilchy
[12/12/21 08:44:32] jaime: I wish it were like that now! At least put password on boot! :)
[08.12.21 08:45:52] weldon: password was stored in CMOS, z lj;t gtht,jhobr rfrjq-nj gbcfk
[08.12.21 08:46:07] weldon: some overkill guy wrote
[08.12.21 08:48:26] jaime: And how did you enter it?
[08.12.21 08:49:30] weldon: I used asm to refer to kmos
[08.12.21 08:49:48] weldon: now I don't even know where the password is...
[08.12.21 08:50:19] weldon: you can't just reset kmos
[08.12.21 08:52:42] jaime: But it is possible to reset, there are utilities. And the settings can be changed.
[08.12.21 08:53:16] weldon: WAN IP is an external IP?
[08.12.21 08:53:33] weldon: hjenthf dcvsckt
[08.12.21 08:53:39] weldon: router
[08.12.21 08:54:01] jaime: You send to router IP, and it will redirect to the local machine by the port number
[08.12.21 08:54:52] weldon: can I ping my router?
[08.12.21 08:55:17] jaime: If ICMP is enabled, why not?
[08.12.21 08:57:05] weldon: UPnP only in options, turn it on and no way
[08.12.21 08:57:46] weldon: When you enable UPnP function, the PC on the LAN side sends a request to the router to do port forwarding automatically. In this case, PCs from the Internet can access resources on the LAN-side PC, including UPnP-enabled applications, which ensures smooth downloading of applications or watching videos.
[08.12.21 09:00:28] jaime: UPnP is not supported by the bios
[08.12.21 09:01:00] jaime: Port trigger seems to be configured
[08.12.21 09:01:23] jaime: What kind of router?
[08.12.21 09:01:53] weldon: HUAWEI WiFi AX3
[08.12.21 09:02:57] weldon: okay, I'll figure it out later, I have to
[08.12.21 09:02:59] weldon: )
[08.12.21 09:03:10] jaime: Does it work from LAN?
[08.12.21 09:03:24] weldon: at router?
[08.12.21 09:03:52] weldon: sure
[08.12.21 09:03:57] jaime: ``

[08.12.21 09:06:22] weldon: hmm, thanks, it's in the nat
[08.12.21 09:53:41] jaime: And you once advised a series about a hacker and a model? Can you remind me the title? :)
[08.12.21 10:23:44] weldon: happy ending
[08.12.21 10:24:25] weldon: It's not a model, it's an aspiring porn actress.)
[08.12.21 10:26:51] jaime: even more interesting! :)
[08.12.21 10:28:41] weldon: the ending is unexpected
[08.12.21 10:29:35] weldon: what's that global problem in the chat room?)
[08.12.21 16:20:10] weldon: ping

[08.12.21 17:14:38] weldon: I was able to enter without torus and vpn about a month or two ago
[08.12.21 17:15:24] jaime: The other day
[08.12.21 17:16:40] weldon: I see.
[08.12.21 17:16:51] weldon: how did you find the movie?)
[10.12.21 10:37:28] weldon: hey, have you seen Franz?
[10.12.21 11:04:03] jaime: Hi, it's on the toad.
[10.12.21 11:04:14] jaime: Haven't been in touch for a week
[10.12.21 11:04:17] jaime: a week
[10.12.21 11:06:16] weldon: i ordered tinkof card, do you think it's better/more logical than sber?
[10.12.21 11:10:52] jaime: i think so, i use it myself.
[17.12.21 08:19:20] weldon: hi
[12/17/221 08:24:31] jaime: hi!
[17.12.21 08:28:07] weldon: does your git work?
[17.12.21 08:36:08] jaime: Let me see.
[12/17/221 08:39:41] jaime: no it's not! :(
[17.12.21 08:50:13] weldon: how much can you pour into git?
[17.12.21 08:50:40] jaime: Not yet the disk is shaky!
[12/17/21 08:50:50] jaime: There's no limit
[17.12.21 08:52:06] weldon: I need almost 2.5 GB...
and something hangs on git add * via tor-browser and wpn (mars)...
[17.12.21 08:54:07] jaime: So add it goes locally
[17.12.21 08:54:24] jaime: Only push to repo
[17.12.21 08:56:47] weldon: well that's how I'm going to add (like you taught)):
	git clone https:***patch_antic.git
	cd patch_antic
	git add *
	git commit -a -m "Added patched FF(ESR91+SB)"
	git push origin master
[12/17/221 08:57:52] weldon: been waiting for 15 mins
[12/17/21 08:58:07] jaime: I think wait some more! :)
[17.12.21 08:58:26] jaime: How many files?
[17.12.21 08:59:26] weldon: tor+mars 2.5 Gb a day will probably be filled, almost 300 000 files)
[17.12.21 09:00:38] jaime: Wait for the hashtag, it will be ready by tomorrow!
[12/17/221 09:01:03] jaime: My git says Access denied for some reason
[12/17/221 09:01:11] jaime: I can go in through the web though
[12/17/221 09:46:01] weldon: it seems to get fluffed (although it used to crash on add VPN), if everything crashes now, will I need to do it all over again?
[17.12.21 09:46:22] jaime: Yes maybe! :)
[17.12.21 09:46:53] jaime: but only to fluff
[12/17/221 09:47:14] weldon: Writing objects: 6% (19581/294265), 68.40 MiB | 155.00 KiB/s
:scream_cat:
[12/17/221 10:34:56] jaime: Well?

[20.12.21 09:39:48] jaime: how's the torus buzzing?
[20.12.21 09:41:42] weldon: yeah) only I requested a bridge, just obfs4 doesn't work
[21.12.21 08:37:55] weldon: hi, how did you fix the disk? is it HDD, which you asked yesterday?
[21.12.21 08:43:06] jaime: Hi!
[21.12.21 08:43:19] jaime: I found some old one with the same size sector
[21.12.21 08:43:26] jaime: I transported it all right :)
[21.12.21 08:43:59] weldon: you can't change sector size without formatting?
[21.12.21 08:58:45] jaime: I don't think you can change it at all, it's a physical parameter
[21.12.21 09:04:42] weldon: only cluster size? I completely forgot all these details, I was playing a long time ago)
[21.12.21 09:05:52] weldon: Int 13 and all that)
[21.12.21 09:12:37] jaime: before they all had 512 sectors, but when they got bigger, they made them 4096
[21.12.21 09:13:00] jaime: So the whole partition table goes
[21.12.21 09:13:15] jaime: 21 more interruptions were MS DOS
[12/21/221 09:13:22] jaime: 13 is like BIOS
[12/21/221 09:14:38] weldon: i remember selling my 2.5Gb HD and buying a new 8Gb one!)
[21.12.21 09:16:59] weldon: that's when it started "banging" and glitching I found faulty places, eliminated them and it worked) still lying somewhere among the ancient scrap metal plushkin:grin
[22.12.21 12:49:33] weldon: hi
[22.12.21 13:03:22] jaime: hi!
[22.12.21 13:04:00] weldon: do you have access to the newbies site?
[22.12.21 13:04:15] jaime: What kind of site is it? No it's not!
[12/22/221 13:04:20] jaime: Never heard of it!
[12/22/221 13:04:41] weldon: Okay.
[22.12.21 13:04:52] jaime: What do they do there?
[22.12.21 13:05:20] weldon: I don't know, they just raise young cattle.)
[22.12.21 13:06:17] weldon: today I got a 1 TB SSL for USB-C, nice speed
[22.12.21 13:27:11] jaime: And what do you store on your external one?
[12/22/221 13:28:19] jaime: I want a Synology DiskStation DS220+ ? Had no experience?
[22.12.21 13:29:04] weldon: nothing so far, I wanted it for synchronization of 2 PCs, but the 2nd PC has no UBS-C on the motherboard
[12/22/221 13:29:46] weldon: [ ](https://xflemdsxjrjilw34dsxpvrxp5whnaut7hc5xejwuqs6eqrkt77bxkwid.onion/direct/Mvt4KwSxtNSNga6NWR2ecGKjyBntC6Rv8K?msg=PeKPd3jL5GLognLQF) no, I didn't, I got the SXS2000
[22.12.21 13:32:40] jaime: I have one from Orico, but I don't use it.
[22.12.21 13:39:18] weldon: Kingston is 3 times slower than ADATA SX8100/8200 (NVMe x3) but 2 times faster than Samsung (Sata)

[28.12.21 09:15:15] weldon: I get it - the speed is terribly slow
[28.12.21 09:15:44] weldon: that's what I wanted to ask you about the git

[28.12.21 20:00:18] jaime: I did it! If anything lies there
[28.12.21 20:01:45] weldon: ok,
think there will be something interesting/relevant?
[28.12.21 20:02:18] weldon: archive with pass?
[12/28/221 20:03:38] jaime: did not repackage as it was!
[12/28/221 20:05:00] jaime: But what's interesting, I think not my brains! :)
[28.12.21 20:05:45] weldon: Does it make sense to poke around there/lose time for the sake of idle interest?)
[28.12.21 20:09:12] jaime: i can't find potential problems of their safety anyway
[12/28/221 20:09:46] weldon: in my youth I liked to get into a virtual ass) kind of annoying accountants who call every 15 minutes, planted svchost which randomly suspended the computer, techs/system guys came and reinstalled the system 20 times, then they changed the computer) without understanding the theme
[12/28/221 20:18:08] jaime: Oh, nice! :)
[28.12.21 20:19:29] weldon: see you tomorrow, go to sleep
[28.12.21 20:19:59] jaime: Accountants' computers are usually fucked up.
[12/28/221 20:20:10] jaime: Go! Good night! :)
[30.12.21 20:54:58] weldon: send me your bridge for testing
[30.12.21 20:55:32] jaime: I haven't picked it up yet, just wanted to
[30.12.21 20:55:44] jaime: Now it works without any bridges

[12/30/21 21:06:06] jaime: what about my bridges?
[12/30/21 21:11:13] weldon: Nada.
[30.12.21 21:12:33] weldon: hangs, hangs, and says nothing...
[12.01.22 09:45:35] jaime: hi! :)
[12.01.22 09:45:44] weldon: hi
[12.01.22 09:46:12] jaime: Do you know how to format start the program via cmd, to overload err stream output of the running program?
[12.01.22 09:46:37] jaime: cmd /C proga.exe 2>&1 overloads for cmd
[12.01.22 09:46:49] jaime: And I need for proga.exe ?
[12.01.22 09:47:27] jaime: don't know how to google
[12.01.22 09:47:45] weldon: cmd /C proga.exe 2>&1
it is redirection
[12.01.22 09:48:01] weldon: to another thread
[12.01.22 09:48:06] jaime: yeah, but it works for cmd
[12.01.22 09:48:17] jaime: I want it for proga.exe
[12.01.22 09:48:42] weldon: well, it depends on the program implementation
[12.01.22 09:48:51] jaime: inside cmd to start proga with redefining output
[12.01.22 09:49:47] jaime: Yes the program outputs in err, and I intercept stdout. If I start with redirected through _popen it swears it's already overloaded
[12.01.22 09:50:18] jaime: my bat file is ok, I want to give up the bat
[12.01.22 09:53:09] weldon: i don't know (i don't understand the problem))) maybe something like cmd /C "proga.exe 2>&1",
[12.01.22 09:53:58] weldon: i.e. you need to redirect the result of proga.exe execution?
[12.01.22 09:54:44] jaime: Yep from proga.exe
[12.01.22 09:54:59] weldon: try brackets
[12.01.22 09:58:15] jaime: tried everything, he thinks I redirect cmd
[12.01.22 10:01:47] weldon: there are special brackets like ^
[12.01.22 10:03:31] jaime: That's interesting.
[12.01.22 10:03:41] weldon: )
[12.01.22 10:05:20] jaime: cmd /C proga.exe 2^>^&^1

[12.01.22 10:05:43] jaime: Yep.
[12.01.22 10:06:15] jaime: Via _popen stream err
[12.01.22 10:07:16] jaime: It's very messy via CreateProcess
[12.01.22 10:07:29] weldon: got it

[12.01.22 17:15:10] jaime: And what did you need to record there? Just for interest
[12.01.22 17:15:46] weldon: check in general chat)
[12.01.22 17:16:06] weldon: i have not a python, but a python-based script
[12.01.22 17:16:31] weldon: there was a fatal error
[12.01.22 17:16:47] jaime: Yeah, got it.

[12.01.22 17:19:01] weldon: there is a hodgepodge of many languages

[14.01.22 11:18:52] jaime: I put lithol on the valve and here we go.
[14.01.22 11:19:07] jaime: But not much comes out rubles 80-90 per day
[14.01.22 11:36:01] weldon: Do you mine with a CPU or video? or both?
[14.01.22 11:36:59] weldon: i wanted to buy a card for 70, got excited already, but it was 128 bit!
have you any idea how much bitrate affects m-g?
[14.01.22 13:34:32] jaime: I'm on the graphics card. I don't know, I don't think so.
[14.01.22 13:34:39] jaime: What kind of video?

[14.01.22 13:38:12] weldon: Yeah
[14.01.22 13:39:11] jaime: If you use it for mining, don't buy it.
[14.01.22 13:39:24] jaime: If you play and mine, you still can
[14.01.22 13:40:55] weldon: my second PC has a GTS 250 1Gb graphics card from 2010 - older than my eldest daughter:laughing:
[14.01.22 13:41:14] weldon: but 256 bit
[14.01.22 13:52:41] jaime: you can't get much profit with 1Gb
[14.01.22 13:53:06] jaime: I can't afford to pay for 70 Gbytes of video. :)
[14.01.22 13:54:46] weldon: yeah, me too) my wife will neuter me)
[14.01.22 13:55:19] weldon: 1Gb graphics card is glitchy, no mining there
[14.01.22 13:59:11] weldon: have you watched hapi end by the way?
[14.01.22 14:00:05] jaime: no I wanted to go with my wife, she didn't like the description. I still can't make it on my own.
