2020-06-22T13:14:20 bentley -> target
Lf

2020-06-22T13:14:21 bentley -> target
Yes

2020-06-22T13:14:25 target -> bentley
1) there bases are as private updated

2020-06-22T13:14:30 target -> bentley
2) is the cloud on there?

2020-06-22T13:14:41 bentley -> target
1 every day I try.

2020-06-22T13:14:43 bentley -> target
2 Yes

2020-06-22T13:15:05 target -> bentley
3) if you compare it to dincheck
all write about 240 sec delay
what is it

2020-06-22T13:15:39 bentley -> target
240 secs of fence? Who writes it?

2020-06-22T13:15:40 target -> bentley
these are all forum chatterers
while reading different threads and dincheck included

2020-06-22T13:15:48 target -> bentley
Like show dincek.

2020-06-22T13:15:53 target -> bentley
But with a keyed internet

2020-06-22T13:15:55 target -> bentley
and 240 sec

2020-06-22T13:15:56 target -> bentley
whatever

2020-06-22T13:16:08 target -> bentley
delay or something like that

2020-06-22T13:16:18 target -> bentley
Some parameter there is like this

2020-06-22T13:16:38 bentley -> target
Now

2020-06-22T13:17:50 bentley -> target
Increase Check Timeout

2020-06-22T13:18:08 bentley -> target
Yes, so that it takes longer for the AV to check

2020-06-22T13:18:19 target -> bentley
Every third person thinks it is necessary to specify the author of the software in the topic

2020-06-22T13:18:23 target -> bentley
like give me a layout with 240 sec.

2020-06-22T13:18:54 target -> bentley
Have our people written anything on the subject here?

2020-06-22T13:18:57 target -> bentley
we don't care about this parameter?

2020-06-22T13:19:18 bentley -> target
Sort of takes longer to check. There's a better chance of detecting

2020-06-22T13:21:49 bentley -> target
The test itself on each av lasts 4 minutes or until detected

2020-06-22T13:24:18 target -> bentley
essentially

2020-06-22T13:24:22 target -> bentley
that's what we have

2020-06-22T13:24:24 target -> bentley
as a test

2020-06-22T13:24:27 target -> bentley


2020-06-22T13:24:45 bentley -> target
Yes, but we have our own autotests

2020-06-22T13:26:49 target -> bentley
I read the report

2020-06-22T13:26:55 bentley -> target
But we also have statics and dynamics and a knockout in the same test

2020-06-22T13:26:56 target -> bentley
there's webroute

2020-06-22T13:26:59 target -> bentley
Sophos

2020-06-22T13:27:00 target -> bentley
and phalcon

2020-06-22T13:27:05 target -> bentley
we were told objects

2020-06-22T13:27:09 target -> bentley
paly echo

2020-06-22T13:27:11 target -> bentley
And we're all clear on the autotests

2020-06-22T13:27:18 target -> bentley
this is me from last week's report

2020-06-22T13:27:22 target -> bentley
operators

2020-06-22T13:27:29 target -> bentley
so the question arose

2020-06-22T13:27:35 target -> bentley
Are the bases updated

2020-06-22T13:27:38 bentley -> target
We don't have Falcon

2020-06-22T13:27:42 target -> bentley
And does the echeck work well?

2020-06-22T13:27:47 bentley -> target
webroot and sofos - yes

2020-06-22T13:27:52 bentley -> target
Yeah ok

2020-06-22T13:28:05 target -> bentley
Yep

2020-06-22T13:28:09 target -> bentley
So there must have been some extra settings

2020-06-22T13:28:18 target -> bentley
maybe the cloud can modules what is it

2020-06-22T13:28:44 bentley -> target
Where exactly?

2020-06-22T13:29:05 target -> bentley
I write bentley.

2020-06-22T13:29:08 target -> bentley
On the day of the attack

2020-06-22T13:29:11 target -> bentley
there have been cases

2020-06-22T13:29:13 target -> bentley
when objects

2020-06-22T13:29:17 target -> bentley
They said the file is blocked

2020-06-22T13:29:20 target -> bentley
operators asked

2020-06-22T13:29:21 target -> bentley
What kind of antivirus

2020-06-22T13:29:23 target -> bentley
or what it says

2020-06-22T13:29:24 bentley -> target
 <target> that means there were some additional settings

2020-06-22T13:29:29 target -> bentley
then wrote in the report

2020-06-22T13:29:31 bentley -> target
Where are the usroids?

2020-06-22T13:29:35 target -> bentley
I just now studied the operator reports

2020-06-22T13:29:45 target -> bentley
In addition to the managers in the office who are over the operators

2020-06-22T13:29:49 target -> bentley
hz

2020-06-22T13:29:52 target -> bentley
But we have

2020-06-22T13:29:54 target -> bentley
I think it was clear.

2020-06-22T13:29:59 target -> bentley
on autotests

2020-06-22T13:30:05 target -> bentley
before attacks

2020-06-22T13:30:07 target -> bentley
and probably after

2020-06-22T13:30:10 bentley -> target
Yes.

2020-06-22T13:30:11 target -> bentley
And there they have it like this

2020-06-22T13:30:15 target -> bentley
That's what I'm saying.

2020-06-22T13:30:18 target -> bentley
what is possible

2020-06-22T13:30:20 target -> bentley
They have some kind of add-on modules

2020-06-22T13:30:22 target -> bentley
whatever

2020-06-22T13:30:23 target -> bentley
or cloud

2020-06-22T13:30:25 target -> bentley
that we don't know about

2020-06-22T13:30:30 target -> bentley
If the autotests are okay

2020-06-22T13:30:36 target -> bentley
So there is something additional at these objects

2020-06-22T13:31:01 bentley -> target
Got it

2020-06-22T13:33:03 target -> bentley
[08:14:46] <target> like give me a layout with 240 sec
[08:15:16] <target> have we written anything on this topic here?
When you run the software on the dincheck machines to check the dynamics, you can add a file check time. Look, we start the file, it performs some actions, antivirus analyzes it... After some time dincheck gives the result, this option allows you to increase checking time, you know it could be that the file sticks on the dynamics, but not immediately, but much later, this option will give a more accurate result

2020-06-22T13:33:07 target -> bentley
do we have a similar check?

2020-06-22T13:35:20 bentley -> target
We have even more than that. First av scans for statics. Then the dynamics and then the bounce to the admin. All in one autotest.

2020-06-22T13:35:45 bentley -> target
That is, all the time the startup to the bouncing goes dynamically

2020-06-22T13:37:02 target -> bentley

2020-06-22T13:38:47 target -> bentley
where he's knocking

ask booza

2020-06-22T13:38:52 target -> bentley
where to check

2020-06-22T13:38:53 target -> bentley
and check

2020-06-22T13:38:58 bentley -> target
He knocks on our server

2020-06-22T13:39:03 target -> bentley
And get in touch with sweet mickey

2020-06-22T13:39:04 bentley -> target

2020-06-22T13:39:07 target -> bentley
Let's pay her 250

2020-06-22T13:39:23 target -> bentley
Here's a check on his bl

2020-06-22T13:39:24 target -> bentley
in theory

2020-06-22T13:39:27 target -> bentley
he should be on the blacklist

2020-06-22T13:39:30 bentley -> target
Right now or should we wait a week?

2020-06-22T13:39:40 target -> bentley
as you see fit

2020-06-22T13:40:06 target -> bentley
The question is.

2020-06-22T13:40:08 target -> bentley
what's the 250 for?

2020-06-22T13:40:11 target -> bentley
paid

2020-06-22T13:40:15 target -> bentley
If in a couple of hours

2020-06-22T13:40:18 target -> bentley
The server will go blacklisted

2020-06-22T13:40:19 target -> bentley
in theory

2020-06-22T13:40:26 target -> bentley
Check with her or him

Certificates should mature

2020-06-25T18:05:31 target -> bentley
I'll keep my opinion to myself.

2020-06-25T18:05:46 target -> bentley
I just know

2020-06-25T18:05:51 target -> bentley
that the certificates that are signed

2020-06-25T18:05:58 target -> bentley
When and how long they live

2020-06-25T18:06:10 target -> bentley
I don't know what will happen to the certificate in the end.

2020-06-25T18:06:16 target -> bentley
which signs the fiels of the profu

2020-06-25T18:06:24 target -> bentley
Whether it's a fox

2020-06-25T18:06:26 target -> bentley
Whether it's a prof.

2020-06-25T18:06:30 target -> bentley
But something in practice

2020-06-25T18:06:32 target -> bentley
That hasn't happened yet.

2020-06-25T18:06:38 target -> bentley
To sert fly away and respond

2020-06-25T18:06:49 bentley -> target
Yes. Very fast

2020-06-25T18:07:06 target -> bentley
And fox says

2020-06-25T18:07:11 target -> bentley
it should be ok

2020-06-25T18:07:16 target -> bentley
But the prof says it's okay, too.

2020-06-25T18:07:18 target -> bentley
should be

2020-06-25T18:07:24 target -> bentley
who to believe here

2020-06-25T18:07:28 target -> bentley
as a result of the killed certificate

2020-06-25T18:07:31 target -> bentley
who by what

2020-06-25T18:07:55 target -> bentley
And the stray files that were signed with this certificate

2020-06-25T18:07:59 target -> bentley
I don't think it's a coincidence.

2020-06-25T18:08:07 bentley -> target
Well the certificate is originally new. Not used.

2020-06-25T18:08:25 target -> bentley
been almost a year now

2020-06-25T18:08:28 target -> bentley
I know that if a cert is lying

2020-06-25T18:08:30 target -> bentley
he's alive

2020-06-25T18:08:36 target -> bentley
If they take him into battle or sign something

2020-06-25T18:08:39 target -> bentley
he dies

2020-06-25T18:08:58 target -> bentley
Let's agree that 50% is fox and 50% is the action of a pro

2020-06-25T18:09:00 target -> bentley
and forget

2020-06-25T18:09:21 target -> bentley
fox is doing a discount of 1,500

1) the requirements for the host for admins loaders purchased and scripts from the admins Boer and Amadeus give drix + Grin - so he put on ftp or vps everything and everything worked, which of them can take a regular or ftp, put the admin and make them work - let them agree between themselves
on Thursday, ask him for the names of the domains where he put, so you'll get new builds from Boer and Amadeus coders
2) on Friday, you should have the epheses from Booher and Amadeus ready, but they are not crypted
hosts for them should be working and loaders should be issued for them
3) the list of ip, which should be added to the admins loaders blacklist
what it is
and if it's used in the backend, if not - must be added

2020-07-08-08T08:11:30 bentley -> target
Hi.

2020-07-08-08T08:11:44 bentley -> target
Are we working?

2020-07-08-08T08:40:28 bentley -> target
<Firefox> Your certificates seem to fly off every 2 months) Maybe it's something with the token?) Both the first and second so. For the first we got a penalty, so for the second there should be some alaverdah if we pick it up.
The fact that there we made a mistake because of which it was impossible to reissue the first cert, it is, but from what you had it was also still an open question, especially since it was 2 months, as now with the second, but this time the situation is simpler. If so every time - we will always owe you for something. Let's at least confine claims to a month, or will be more mutually settled without penalty, but with free reissue, if it is physically possible. These are my thoughts. I'll post the reissue tomorrow and look forward to your suggestions.

ask him
why 7 bots got access
and why they all went off fast
if the echo was downloaded afterwards

and ask why they all have a medgroup grid
there can not be 7 objects from medgroup
you can even tell by the name of the pc that these are other companies (you are a fool not to ask for a link to who they are referring to)

give me a report later on what he has to say on these two issues

<Firefox> So let's somehow limit our grants by time or cost
[01:20:35] <volhvb> Are you suggesting 2 months?
[01:20:42] <Firefox> A month
[01:21:00] <Firefox> Otherwise we won't make ends meet
[01:21:19] <Firefox> It's not always technically possible to reissue
[01:21:26] <volhvb> I get it. I'll write you when we discuss.
[01:21:34] <Firefox> Ok
[01:21:53] <Firefox> And write off that penalty, it hit us hard, we're really fucked
[01:22:48] <Firefox> Let's start from scratch
[01:23:20] <Firefox> Price is the same and reissue if possible
[01:23:41] <Firefox> We're not rats
[01:23:55] <Firefox> But we can not work in deficit
[01:24:10] <volhvb> We'll look for a solution

[01:25:41] <Firefox> Get these thoughts to the bosses please

[01:28:50] <Firefox> Long-term guarantees were not discussed originally and we can't provide them 100%
[01:29:15] <Firefox> Not because we don't want to but because it's not always possible

[01:30:15] <Firefox> When it's possible - no question, but when it's not - we are not in a position to make a manifest after 2 months

[01:32:13] <Firefox> Fair?

1) it is important! what Boer replied - and how do we solve the questions we asked
2) important! what domain is specified in config where the Boer bot knocks
3) important! what ip is he specified or linked to the domain where the bot knocks
give them please
4) make the booth by 13 00 - 2 versions please
name as usual
icons are not necessary
5) then give me a wallet for beer
6) tell us briefly what fox wants from us in a nutshell
7) important! give us a report on how the booza responded to the bots yesterday
they got shit all of a sudden or after you gave out the link to the old truck to the cameramen
Just remember somehow

2020-07-08T22:52:19 target -> bentley
important! tried to set a task

only the ephe is specified and the quantity and start
and not executed

2020-07-08T23:32:56 target -> bentley
maybe for the exe, you need to specify a method like Load

15:16:34] <buza> there is such a thing as reputation av
[15:16:48] <buza> brand new file has no reputation and it gets blocked by avs
[15:17:09] <buza> file that shined a little, it was already running on machines, got into the av cloud as a sample and got reputation
[15:17:25] <buza> from this point of view, a day old file is probably even better than a file right out of the blue
[15:17:50] <buza> so maybe you should really give yesterday's run-in files - the main thing is to run them on real machines with av
[15:17:54] <buza> here's just a thought
[15:18:30] <bentley> do you mean on our avs or on client ones?
[15:18:53] <buza> well look, I just found out this thing this week
[15:19:04] <buza> that before launching into battle, hackers give reputation to files
[15:19:36] <buza> they run it on their vm, and when the av starts yelling, they tell the av like it's ok, it's a good file
[15:19:39] <buza> don't delete it
[15:20:01] <buza> so in the cloud av gets info about the file with so-and-so hash and that the user ran the file and approved it
[15:20:06] <buza> I don't know exactly the mechanism
[15:20:11] <buza> but that's it
[15:20:14] <buza> no other explanation
[15:21:03] <bentley> Interesting. Got it.
[15:21:08] <buza> maybe that's why I see old bots popping up out of nowhere

[15:21:19] <buza> that I gave a command to update some time ago and they died immediately
[15:21:34] <buza> they died probably because update had no reputation
[15:21:46] <buza> and now when file was promoted it became kind of legitimate

<buer@thesecure.biz> Good afternoon)

Sorry, didn't see the messages.

Task execution time is ~15 minutes from the start of the task (this timeout is regulated inside /home/publish/app/appsettings.json), commands for bots are available immediately after creation (i.e. when connected they will immediately execute a bunch of active tasks)
If commands are not executed, it means that there was no request for them
On the task page there is information on it, throw it from those cases where there was such a delay
Methods of loading - the method of running, if we're talking about the same thing. They adjust to your selected file (EXE/DLL). For all EXE types it's better to use LocalExe (local launch) or MemLoadEx (run in memory of native 32-bit applications), for DLL it depends on DLL itself and better check all launch methods for each specific file (loader guarantees the launch attempt, but cannot guarantee the correct operation of file in memory, for example)

2020-07-09T12:17:40 target -> bentley
Go to the customs broker and pick up the phones, invoices for Olga, the purpose of use in the call center, indicate in the explanation that the 42 pieces of phones are not for commercial purposes, type of communication VOICE IP telephony, attach the documents for the company and activity codes

:-O what a service

2020-07-09T12:23:07 target -> bentley
then here's another bentley urgent task for you besides a winds server and installing a coba there

2020-07-09T12:26:25 target -> bentley
1) take a dll from coba from GREEN crypted or yesterday's
2) get a list of parameter commands to run koba
3) enter admin area
4) together with Boozer, give a command to US bots that are online (which have a tag of 8)
5) but give it so that the parameters were correct and everything worked

On 3-5 bots no more limit

as soon as it's done
ask Greene if someone new has dropped out (tell him right away that you're about to upload a few bots to the coba) so he can wait

if it didn't cool down
make it so that it dries out.
find a parameter that will work for the dll coba

in the BC admins is working parameter rundll timeout 0 parameter!!! StartW

I don't know what will work in the boer (discuss with him)

2020-07-09T12:26:28 target -> bentley
you can do itYu

2020-07-09T12:26:29 target -> bentley
?

2020-07-09T12:26:54 target -> bentley
the goal is not just to make commands work
but for bots to reach (3-5 pieces with tag 8) from boer to coba to grin and it will confirm

2020-07-09T12:26:59 bentley -> target
Will do. Just need a login password on the duer

2020-07-10T15:21:56 target -> bentley

2020-07-10T15:21:59 target -> bentley

When a bad crypt.
it offers to delete

When a file without a certificate
it prompts you to save but warns you

2 died quickly
1 lived 3-4 days

2020-07-13T19:17:31 bentley -> target
What doesn't add up?

2020-07-13T19:17:47 target -> bentley
<bentley> 3 certs were bought. 2 died quickly. Now working on the third one.

2020-07-13T19:17:52 bentley -> target
Yes

2020-07-13T19:18:08 target -> bentley
3 bought
2 died quickly
1 lived 3-4 days
1 is now being popped.

2020-07-13T19:18:11 target -> bentley
4 comes out

2020-07-13T19:18:12 target -> bentley
not 3

2020-07-13T19:18:15 target -> bentley
Or am I missing something here?

2020-07-13T19:18:24 bentley -> target
1 script we are working with now

2020-07-13T19:18:43 target -> bentley
ah got it

2020-07-13T19:18:55 target -> bentley
Anyway, 3 bought
1 ok
1 died
1 gave out a script

2020-07-13T19:19:47 target -> bentley
In general, if this one is ok (which recript)

2020-07-13T19:19:50 target -> bentley
then forget about the one that died

2020-07-13T19:19:59 target -> bentley
because it most likely died from the actions of the prof

2020-07-13T19:20:16 bentley -> target
I see. What do you mean by ok?

2020-07-13T19:20:37 bentley -> target
2 weeks to live?

2020-07-13T19:20:41 target -> bentley
If it survives 3 or 4 days

2020-07-13T19:20:42 bentley -> target
Amesto 4 wives?

2020-07-13T19:20:53 target -> bentley
Where did the 2 week figure come from?

2020-07-13T19:21:07 bentley -> target
I think that's how it used to be with Andi

2020-07-13T19:21:19 bentley -> target
Or am I mixing something up?

2020-07-13T19:21:20 target -> bentley
andy's sertas have been living the same way

2020-07-13T19:21:21 target -> bentley
3-4 days

2020-07-13T19:21:22 target -> bentley
maximum

2020-07-13T19:21:30 bentley -> target
Ahh. I see.

2020-07-13T19:22:23 target -> bentley
All in all, we bought three certificates

1 died from the prof (it seems) - we asked for a new certificate
he gave cert 2 - it also fell off - HE gave a replacement (it now work)
and another 3 cert - with it all was ok (3 days worked)

2020-07-13T19:22:23 target -> bentley
right?

2020-07-13T19:22:37 bentley -> target
yes

2020-07-13T19:23:27 target -> bentley

2020-07-14T18:26:32 target -> bentley

That the operators through the hall managers in the office

could work

2020-07-14T18:28:27 target -> bentley

here are 20+ people waiting for the link

2020-07-14T18:29:36 bentley -> target

2020-07-14T18:30:13 target -> bentley

2020-07-14T18:30:15 target -> bentley
monitor everything

2020-07-14T18:30:39 target -> bentley
they have links, they're in the operator's trillo
can only report what's going on in the hall and who said what from the objects

2020-07-14T18:30:46 target -> bentley
But this is an extreme case in general

2020-07-14T18:30:52 target -> bentley
And we have this all the time.

2020-07-14T18:31:13 target -> bentley
It would be better if the staff were not disturbed at all with complaints about the eche

2020-07-14T18:31:27 target -> bentley
and managers performed their direct duties to control the operational processes

2020-07-14T18:31:41 target -> bentley
and it was only updated with a link

2020-07-14T18:31:43 target -> bentley
they were giving them away

2020-07-14T18:31:53 target -> bentley
they will not be able to get into the link virus detections

2020-07-14T18:33:07 target -> bentley
If the echo is screwed on

2020-07-14T18:33:23 target -> bentley
someone is bound to say that from the objects

2020-07-14T18:33:23 target -> bentley
all or part of the operators stop working

2020-07-14T18:33:26 target -> bentley
managers report

2020-07-14T18:33:35 target -> bentley
what the operators tell them

2020-07-14T18:33:38 target -> bentley

2020-07-15T16:13:10 target -> bentley
it turns out you didn't test it right?

2020-07-15T16:13:12 target -> bentley
just say yes.

2020-07-15T16:13:20 target -> bentley
So you're going to test in the future

2020-07-15T16:13:37 bentley -> target
Now I will start with the manual run, then if everything is ok - the autotests

2020-07-15T16:14:17 target -> bentley
So you admit that you have not tested this executable which was in work for an hour and only after I saw that 0 in botnet for an hour + operators have clarified what kind of error there + I ran it already on the PC file - it turned out to be broken

2020-07-15T16:14:22 target -> bentley
Say yes or no.

2020-07-15T16:14:26 target -> bentley
And we'll close the question.

2020-07-15T16:15:42 bentley -> target
Yeah my fuck up.

2020-07-15T16:16:33 target -> bentley
you're lucky it wasn't the corps that were preparing to stern in the beginning
it was only 20-30 corp nets big fuckin
the issue is closed

2020-07-15T16:18:56 target -> bentley

2020-07-15T16:19:36 bentley -> target

No. You gave me just under 200 for beer that was normal. Almost every week.

When there's a flood of downloads and marks in BC I just don't have time to take out. Because they still throw up other work on Crypts and tests. Therefore, we need another person for download. Ideally from Moscow or St. Petersburg at night could work.

2020-07-21T17:16:51 target -> bentley
[13:15:30] <target> what I ultimately want to get
[13:15:34] <target> put a pc
[13:15:39] <target> locally on it to raise 15 virtual machines
[13:15:43] <target> on virtualbox
[13:15:57] <target> to script
[13:16:03] <target> run the exe from the folder
[13:16:05] <target> on these virtualboxes
[13:16:28] <target> put the file on ftp
[13:16:33] <target> and checked
[13:16:40] <target> and not to wait
[13:16:50] <target> while there's a queue of different people
[13:16:56] <target> will allow it to do it or il ilsoglsoy
[13:17:25] <target> + it will control visually

2020-07-21T17:16:55 target -> bentley
this is feasible on those scripts

2020-07-21T17:17:00 target -> bentley
what's in the tempo

2020-07-21T17:17:04 target -> bentley
I optisal him.

2020-07-21T17:17:27 bentley -> target
Yes Booza will do.

2020-07-21T17:17:35 bentley -> target
It's not that simple.

2020-07-21T17:17:47 bentley -> target
Most likely you will have to buy the same server as ours

2020-07-21T17:17:56 bentley -> target
There's a two-way connection there.

2020-07-21T17:18:01 bentley -> target
As far as I'm concerned.

2020-07-21T17:19:11 target -> bentley
Anyway, okay, he'll come and tell me.
I do not want to burden his people and wait until they are free

2020-07-21T17:19:18 bentley -> target
Yep.

2020-07-21T17:19:20 target -> bentley
And I don't want to be crammed in with someone to disrupt my process

2020-07-21T17:19:33 bentley -> target
The right approach

2020-07-21T17:19:38 target -> bentley
shit

2020-07-21T17:19:38 target -> bentley
shit

2020-07-21T17:19:40 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:20:00 bentley -> target
Yep this one can

2020-07-21T17:20:00 target -> bentley
so

2020-07-21T17:30:46 target -> bentley
By the way

2020-07-21T17:30:49 target -> bentley
How's your boyfriend

2020-07-21T17:30:52 target -> bentley
offline

2020-07-21T17:30:53 target -> bentley
what does

2020-07-21T17:31:28 bentley -> target
He's a computer repairman. Really wanted to work as an assistant. Just the right time zone for us.

2020-07-21T17:35:03 target -> bentley
Have him give his phone number.

2020-07-21T17:35:14 target -> bentley
Let's try to work with it again

2020-07-21T17:35:19 target -> bentley
It's clear that we won't forget about you.

2020-07-21T17:35:26 target -> bentley
Once you've proven yourself

2020-07-21T17:35:43 target -> bentley
maybe the second time will show, taking into account the previous situations

2020-07-21T17:36:24 bentley -> target
What do you mean, let's not forget about me? )

2020-07-21T17:36:34 target -> bentley
in good

2020-07-21T17:36:46 bentley -> target
Okay

2020-07-21T17:36:52 target -> bentley
the first time I seem to have taken all interests into account

2020-07-21T17:36:54 target -> bentley
And yours and his

2020-07-21T17:37:08 bentley -> target
Yeah, he didn't take it out when the office opened.

2020-07-21T17:37:19 bentley -> target
And on the job as an assistant - will take out

2020-07-21T17:37:20 target -> bentley
If he doesn't whine about the money, we'll try again with him

2020-07-21T17:37:37 bentley -> target
Where do you want me to drop his number? Or Toad or cart?

2020-07-21T17:37:47 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:37:52 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:38:13 target -> bentley
Is he from spb?

2020-07-21T17:38:16 target -> bentley
By the way

2020-07-21T17:38:23 target -> bentley
By the will of fate

2020-07-21T17:38:24 bentley -> target
Yes

2020-07-21T17:38:27 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:38:27 bentley -> target
He lives there.

2020-07-21T17:38:27 target -> bentley
ok

2020-07-21T17:38:39 target -> bentley
What's his salary

2020-07-21T17:38:40 target -> bentley
now

2020-07-21T17:38:58 bentley -> target
He has no permanent salary per se.

2020-07-21T17:39:06 bentley -> target
30-70 floats

2020-07-21T17:39:16 bentley -> target
There are clients - there is money - no clients - no money

2020-07-21T17:39:45 bentley -> target
Works as a computer wizard

2020-07-21T17:42:48 target -> bentley
Yep

2020-07-21T17:42:56 target -> bentley
contact him

2020-07-21T17:42:58 target -> bentley
And talk to him.

2020-07-21T17:43:03 target -> bentley
I'll give you the fix.

2020-07-21T17:43:07 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:43:19 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:43:20 bentley -> target
How much is the fix?

2020-07-21T17:43:22 target -> bentley
he wasn't nagging

2020-07-21T17:43:33 target -> bentley
70k for the first couple of months

2020-07-21T17:43:36 target -> bentley
all in spb

2020-07-21T17:43:59 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:44:12 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:44:57 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T17:45:20 target -> bentley

2020-07-21T20:59:04 bentley -> target
I am running on a local virtual machine

2020-07-21T20:59:13 target -> bentley
can you drop it on the server?

2020-07-21T20:59:22 target -> bentley
like streaks

2020-07-21T20:59:24 bentley -> target
You have to raise the environment there

gave the server

2020-07-21T20:59:25 target -> bentley

What does the boosa say? Will you have a separate dedicated test server + cryptopane?

2020-07-23T12:04:51 target -> bentley
Yes he did.

2020-07-23T12:04:54 target -> bentley
that it's not that simple there

2020-07-23T12:05:49 bentley -> target
Yes. You can do based on our cryptopanel with dedicated permissions and a separate test server - a clone of this one.

2020-07-23T12:05:53 bentley -> target
It's faster that way

2020-07-23T12:07:27 target -> bentley
I think that's how it was decided.

2020-07-23T12:08:15 bentley -> target

what does it have to do with the question if I asked to buy, not to ask if it's worth it or not

2020-07-27T18:33:40 bentley -> target
I wrote to Stern.

2020-07-27T18:33:49 bentley -> target
And he told you to write back

2020-07-27T18:33:56 target -> bentley
Because you asked him a question.

you don't need to buy from this guy at 2350 now

Let Stern decide

That's right.

2020-07-27T18:39:05 target -> bentley
30 new certs - emphasis on that

dirtier than a booer

when installing certificates from megatrafer?

2020-07-28T18:33:52 target -> bentley

2020-07-28T18:35:48 target -> bentley

[15:06:26] <bentley> and you're looking at ace pads?

I was just looking at the Boer IP.
It's only two avs.

Before that, a week ago, I was looking at the bk.

Just pondering the theory of what influences the suction from objects

2020-07-28T19:03:08 target -> bentley
even the bullet now said that it is necessary - will restore everything

2020-07-28T19:03:30 target -> bentley
it's like he's being asked to fucking redraft
he's being asked to legally reissue a certificate that's been valid for a year

2020-07-28T19:03:36 target -> bentley
and they sell it as a certificate outstanding for a year

2020-07-28T19:04:09 target -> bentley

There is a link to download the Zip archive in the description. Download it. Run it, enter the password and the certificate will be installed on the flash drive. You need to install the drivers on the flash drive.

To make it work in the system

2020-08-18T16:51:01 bentley -> target

2020-08-20T07:31:06 target -> bentley
and testers

2020-08-20T07:31:09 bentley -> target
Fucking

2020-08-20T07:31:14 target -> bentley
What's up with the bk

2020-08-20T07:31:23 bentley -> target
Training a helper to test the BC

2020-08-20T07:31:47 bentley -> target
I run 2-3 builds in a circle per day on 3 machines.

2020-08-20T07:32:55 bentley -> target
We do need our own test machines with all the corp avs. Already there is a waiting list of current coders, testers, customers

2020-08-20T07:33:13 bentley -> target
And when it starts flowing in the fall, it's going to be a total bummer.

2020-08-20T07:33:14 target -> bentley

2020-08-20T07:33:14 target -> bentley

2020-08-20T07:33:17 target -> bentley
put

2020-08-20T07:33:38 target -> bentley
I knew it

2020-08-20T07:33:40 target -> bentley
I freaked out about three weeks ago.

2020-08-20T07:33:45 target -> bentley
said all his will be by corp av

2020-08-20T07:33:51 target -> bentley
so you don't have to wait in the fucking queue for a tree.

2020-08-20T07:33:53 bentley -> target
Yes that's right.

2020-08-20T07:34:16 bentley -> target
Derek, Paul, Balzac, and 5 other coders all want to test their build

2020-08-20T07:34:44 target -> bentley
fucking

2020-08-20T07:34:48 target -> bentley
And I ordered the corp av.

2020-08-20T07:35:13 bentley -> target
Yep BC in itself obliges corp av for development ))

2020-08-20T07:35:26 bentley -> target
It turns out you created a BC Stream ))

2020-08-20T07:35:42 target -> bentley
bk idea

2020-08-20T07:35:47 target -> bentley
ancestor

2020-08-20T07:35:48 target -> bentley
there were 2 lowers

2020-08-20T07:35:52 target -> bentley
From mashroom and cactus

2020-08-20T07:35:59 bentley -> target
I'll remember.)

2020-08-20T07:36:05 target -> bentley
and then I had the idea to make a bk

2020-08-20T07:36:14 target -> bentley
The guys there joined in and helped me with all the details.

2020-08-20T07:36:16 target -> bentley
in tz

2020-08-20T07:36:18 target -> bentley
And the bouza has taken

2020-08-20T07:36:20 target -> bentley
and oragnized

2020-08-20T07:36:26 target -> bentley
then we tested with blood and sweat

2020-08-20T07:36:33 target -> bentley
then corp av

2020-08-20T07:36:48 bentley -> target
Made history ))

2020-08-20T07:36:49 target -> bentley
And then we decided to make each box based on our solutions

2020-08-20T07:37:00 target -> bentley
Well, I have a positive attitude towards it.

2020-08-20T07:37:02 target -> bentley
very

2020-08-20T07:37:08 target -> bentley
Because everyone will use it.

2020-08-20T07:37:10 target -> bentley
in the command

2020-08-20T07:37:15 target -> bentley
and the effect will be

2020-08-20T07:37:25 bentley -> target
Yes.

2020-08-20T07:37:28 bentley -> target
I agree.

2020-08-20T07:37:38 target -> bentley
I'm just pissed that they suggested that I wait until all their problems are solved there
was

2020-08-20T07:37:56 target -> bentley
bouza put me at ease.
gave the best coders and offered to duplicate the system

2020-08-20T07:48:03 target -> bentley

2020-08-20T07:48:14 target -> bentley

2020-08-20T07:48:14 bentley -> target
and it's easier to control

2020-08-20T07:48:26 target -> bentley
I already knew that.

2020-08-20T07:48:28 target -> bentley
by operator

2020-08-20T07:48:32 target -> bentley
But for coders, I haven't thought about

2020-08-20T07:48:40 target -> bentley
what's the difference

2020-08-20T07:48:40 target -> bentley
here we go

2020-08-20T08:08:32 bentley -> target
Awesome! Will speed up the work in general!!!!

2020-08-20T08:08:45 target -> bentley
and it will be like this

2020-08-20T08:08:51 target -> bentley
dploj loads the ehe

2020-08-20T08:09:01 target -> bentley
more precisely

2020-08-20T08:09:02 target -> bentley
tester

2020-08-20T08:09:09 target -> bentley
ehe is checked by autosystems

2020-08-20T08:09:11 target -> bentley
visually

2020-08-20T08:09:16 target -> bentley
similarly

2020-08-20T08:09:21 target -> bentley
then puts it on fill

2020-08-20T08:09:24 target -> bentley
then the eche links

2020-08-20T08:09:26 target -> bentley
and then autocheck

2020-08-20T08:09:29 target -> bentley
If the fyle flies off

2020-08-20T08:09:35 target -> bentley
then the tester/cryptor

2020-08-20T08:09:36 target -> bentley
file goes away

2020-08-20T08:09:39 target -> bentley
straight to the script

2020-08-20T08:09:41 target -> bentley
query

2020-08-20T08:09:52 target -> bentley
as soon as

2020-08-20T08:09:54 target -> bentley
The script is issued

2020-08-20T08:09:58 target -> bentley
The file is checked automatically at the same time

2020-08-20T08:09:58 bentley -> target
How does the request come in?

2020-08-20T08:10:02 target -> bentley
without waiting for the person

2020-08-20T08:10:08 target -> bentley
And if ok on the funnel

2020-08-20T08:10:13 target -> bentley
Whatever you say, that's the way it's going to be.

2020-08-20T08:10:24 target -> bentley
The man is only needed as a machine operator

2020-08-20T08:10:28 target -> bentley
which makes sure the line works

2020-08-20T08:10:35 bentley -> target
yes it's good

2020-08-20T08:10:36 target -> bentley
this will be your tester

2020-08-20T08:10:42 bentley -> target
super!

2020-08-20T08:11:08 bentley -> target
The alert is supposed to be

2020-08-20T08:12:40 bentley -> target

2020-08-20T08:13:21 target -> bentley
Yep

2020-08-20T08:14:14 bentley -> target
Yep

2020-08-20T08:14:50 bentley -> target
and most importantly there is no one control

2020-08-20T08:15:05 target -> bentley
What do you mean

2020-08-20T08:15:07 target -> bentley
About the script?

2020-08-20T08:15:12 bentley -> target

2020-08-20T08:15:49 target -> bentley
simple

2020-08-20T08:15:56 target -> bentley

2020-08-20T08:16:00 bentley -> target
well yeah so

2020-08-20T08:16:00 target -> bentley

Yep

2020-08-31T17:53:38 target -> bentley
what are you stern writing?!
are the bk's ready?!
1) what did you tell me on pt - bk is not ready
we moved everyone from the Mon by Objects
2) What did you tell me today?
That there is no backup from the bouza, and we are not working.
3) above you pinned the echo that takes down corp avs

and you sternly write about 4 bk?!
Is that a joke or something?

2020-08-31T17:54:46 bentley -> target
Yes on Friday there were detects on def the rest is ok. Van said he cleaned it up.

2020-08-31T17:55:03 bentley -> target
This is the BC from Swift.

2020-08-31T17:55:11 bentley -> target
Which I have discounted for you.

2020-08-31T17:55:22 bentley -> target
And the old trike.

2020-08-31T17:56:46 target -> bentley
What the hell are you writing to me here?
you told me loud and clear.
1) BK is DIRTY for us on Mon and will be resolved
- we started to transfer contacts from Mon agreed
2) you tell me clearly that there is no storm and signatures can not work
- We are moving contacts from today.
3) the ones you gave above the bk - their corp avs are torn down

what is this arrow shift

2020-08-31T17:59:11 bentley -> target
1. BC only strayed on Def because I did not give out on Friday. On the corp av all was ok on Friday. 2. Buza came later today and made signatures. 3. This BK from another coder. Van doesn't make anyone but you.

2020-08-31T18:01:34 target -> bentley
What are you trying to say?
that everything is ready to work?
and we're not ready to work?

or do you want to explicitly write
that we don't work
because you didn't give us any working software for today.

2020-08-31T18:02:02 target -> bentley
first of all
Second, I have a different picture of the BC from the testing department
it is not pruoskat corp av
now they are forming a report for you

2020-08-31T18:02:21 bentley -> target
How about I give you Friday's crypto?

2020-08-31T18:02:46 bentley -> target
Or better yet, wait for the new build tomorrow - crypt.

2020-08-31T18:04:19 target -> bentley
so you write sterna fuck&!!! please
you don't have anything ready for today
because with the crypts you solved
because you did not sign the bouza and you told us this morning that it was not ok
and it's not clear what's going on with the bk

Because you write here sternly that you are saints
and we don't want/can't work

we're fucking adjusting to you...!;.%!"

2020-08-31T18:04:35 bentley -> target
I'll write it up in a minute.

2020-08-31T18:45:10 bentley -> target
yes now i'll test your group's crypt - i'll send you for a test.

2020-08-31T18:45:16 bentley -> target
And I will check the source

2020-08-31T18:48:43 target -> bentley
so that the test would be

2020-08-31T18:48:45 target -> bentley

2020-08-31T18:48:48 target -> bentley
put it on the trust host

[21:53:40] <buza> when you just run a file, only the main scanner is triggered
[21:53:56] <buza> when you download it, it adds smartscreen and browser integration
[21:54:00] <buza> there could be other heuristics

2020-09-01T15:18:34 target -> bentley
clearly

2020-09-01T15:18:39 bentley -> target

Bk's are dirty at Mashroom and Van's on Defender. There's also 1 build from Frog that I'm testing.

2020-09-03T09:31:16 target -> bentley
do they have one method in common?

2020-09-03T09:32:24 bentley -> target
All have a Process Hollowing method but different implementations of this method

2020-09-03T09:36:37 bentley -> target
Process Hollowing without saving bk files to disk

What I asked for yesterday

2020-09-04T06:56:33 bentley -> target
Yes. Done.

2020-09-04T06:56:34 target -> bentley
we decided to do it in a different way
There they will be trained by another person according to his method

2020-09-04T06:56:36 target -> bentley
But

2020-09-04T06:56:38 bentley -> target
when do we start?

2020-09-04T06:56:43 bentley -> target
aah

2020-09-04T06:56:44 target -> bentley
Let's start today.

2020-09-04T06:56:45 target -> bentley
during the day

2020-09-04T06:57:05 target -> bentley
let it be my training and man

2020-09-04T06:57:07 target -> bentley
We'll show you from the arz sides.

2020-09-04T06:57:13 target -> bentley
What's up with the bk.

2020-09-04T06:57:15 target -> bentley
any news?

2020-09-04T06:57:20 target -> bentley
inform

2020-09-04T06:57:30 target -> bentley
I do not understand how others work with such software

2020-09-04T06:57:32 target -> bentley
and whether or not the

2020-09-04T06:57:33 target -> bentley
with a bk

2020-09-04T06:59:05 bentley -> target
No one is working with either the BC or the rick right now. Everything is being cleaned up. There is 1 build from Frog. The sources are clean. Gotta check the crypt.

2020-09-04T06:59:30 bentley -> target
I hope to do it today. Deploy is off for the 2nd day. Marcel is not doing well. He was engaged by Morse.

2020-09-04T07:00:36 target -> bentley
How did he anagine it

2020-09-04T07:00:48 bentley -> target
I've got my work cut out for me

2020-09-04T07:01:02 target -> bentley
ok

2020-09-04T07:01:13 target -> bentley
Good for you for saying

2020-09-04T07:01:17 target -> bentley
So you also need new cryptors

2020-09-04T07:01:18 target -> bentley
ok there will be

2020-09-04T07:01:28 target -> bentley
are there any specifics of the crypt?

2020-09-04T07:01:31 target -> bentley
bk or tric.

2020-09-04T07:01:35 bentley -> target
Yeah Deploy is just our locomotive.

2020-09-04T07:01:38 target -> bentley
so that when the cryptors are interviewed

2020-09-04T07:02:02 bentley -> target
I'll talk to Marcel about it.

2020-09-04T07:03:23 target -> bentley
ok

2020-09-04T07:03:25 target -> bentley
talk to

2020-09-04T07:03:28 target -> bentley
Email me right away.

2020-09-04T07:03:33 bentley -> target
Ok.

2020-09-04T07:03:34 target -> bentley
Because if this is the question.

2020-09-04T07:03:38 target -> bentley
az the weekend.

2020-09-04T07:03:41 target -> bentley
This will have to be solved.

2020-09-04T07:03:52 target -> bentley
to take the software on Mon and get it crypted
and then test before writing

2020-09-04T07:04:00 bentley -> target
Yes we ideally need a dedicated cryptor. A good skinny one that's purely for us.

2020-09-04T07:04:05 target -> bentley
well done moron

2020-09-04T07:04:08 target -> bentley
on time he

2020-09-04T07:04:21 target -> bentley
Yes, I will spend 2k a month on it.

2020-09-04T07:04:37 target -> bentley
That's enough.

2020-09-04T07:04:40 target -> bentley
such a market?

2020-09-04T07:04:43 target -> bentley
or which one

2020-09-04T07:04:49 bentley -> target
Yes

2020-09-04T07:04:57 target -> bentley
about 12 years ago it was like this.
2k for a month the technician had a crypt or whatever his name was

2020-09-04T07:05:03 target -> bentley
here we go

2020-09-04T10:23:02 target -> bentley
hi

2020-09-04T10:23:06 target -> bentley
eche files are necessary

2020-09-04T10:23:08 target -> bentley
and nyuns

2020-09-04T10:23:09 target -> bentley
the cryptors are

2020-09-04T10:23:11 target -> bentley
much

2020-09-04T10:23:21 target -> bentley
and how to test them

2020-09-04T10:23:38 bentley -> target
So right now.

2020-09-04T10:26:24 target -> bentley
[13:06:53] <stern (partner)> many@ another crypto

2020-09-04T10:26:25 target -> bentley
What's wrong with it?

2020-09-04T10:26:29 target -> bentley
Is he busy with us too?

2020-09-04T10:26:53 bentley -> target
It's bigger by the docs. But also crypting trike BC hasn't crypted yet

2020-09-04T10:28:57 target -> bentley
Yeah, got it.

2020-09-04T10:29:00 target -> bentley
then the files

2020-09-04T10:29:02 target -> bentley
cryptor features

2020-09-04T10:29:05 target -> bentley
and how to test

2020-09-04T10:29:08 target -> bentley
the cryptos themselves

2020-09-04T10:29:12 target -> bentley
To understand good krpit bad krpit

2020-09-04T10:36:28 bentley -> target
How to test crypto. Run on machines with updated AB 10, 2019. И 7. Wait for the knockout in the BC admin and run Get sysinfo queries ran ehe ran dll ran bat ran turned to wait for the queries to complete. Watch the windows on the machine to see if the ehe and dll queries appear. After a successful execution of the previous request, restart the machine and repeat the getsinfo ran eh ran dll ran bat and ran vershel again. If everything works and there are no detects, the test is passed.

2020-09-04T10:41:17 target -> bentley
so what

2020-09-04T10:41:20 target -> bentley
You're going to do it yourself.

2020-09-04T10:41:25 target -> bentley
Or maybe you should get some helpers.

2020-09-04T10:41:57 bentley -> target
Yes, I can do it myself + I can teach someone.

2020-09-04T10:43:14 target -> bentley
okay

2020-09-04T10:43:21 target -> bentley
Only you will need to test

2020-09-04T10:43:25 target -> bentley
30 krypts or so.

2020-09-04T10:43:33 target -> bentley
well at least 15 eche BC

2020-09-04T10:43:41 target -> bentley
we have 16 cryptors already

2020-09-04T10:43:44 bentley -> target
on how many cars?

2020-09-04T10:43:53 target -> bentley
I don't know how you decide.

2020-09-04T10:43:57 target -> bentley
check whether a good crypt is good or not

2020-09-04T10:43:57 bentley -> target
With what avs?

2020-09-04T10:44:11 bentley -> target
By running and tapping and on the corp av whether or not there is a detection

2020-09-04T10:44:17 target -> bentley
well crypt on corp av is at least rantime so it's sort of not necessary to check this is a matter of codero or am i wrong

2020-09-04T10:44:41 bentley -> target
Need. To run

2020-09-04T10:44:53 bentley -> target
On download from the link, too

2020-09-04T10:44:59 target -> bentley
i.e.

2020-09-04T10:45:03 target -> bentley
it's a crypt

2020-09-04T10:45:05 target -> bentley
is responsible for this

2020-09-04T10:45:06 target -> bentley
not a coder

2020-09-04T10:45:08 target -> bentley
for the rant.

2020-09-04T10:45:10 bentley -> target
I usually test on 3 machines: 7 10 12019

2020-09-04T10:45:41 bentley -> target
I don't understand. Do you take your code and crypt it out?

2020-09-04T10:45:50 bentley -> target
Or our bk and crypto?

2020-09-04T10:45:56 target -> bentley
what's your code)

2020-09-04T10:45:59 target -> bentley
I'm not a coder.

2020-09-04T10:46:03 target -> bentley
I'll take our bk.

2020-09-04T10:46:08 target -> bentley
I give to the cryptor

2020-09-04T10:46:10 target -> bentley
they give out an echo

2020-09-04T10:46:13 bentley -> target
Crypt is checked both statically and randomly

2020-09-04T10:46:17 target -> bentley
this echo look at the statics

2020-09-04T10:46:19 target -> bentley
if it's ok

2020-09-04T10:46:20 target -> bentley
cryptor ok

2020-09-04T10:46:24 target -> bentley
And for ranting dynamics

2020-09-04T10:46:25 bentley -> target
And by running it to see if it works.

2020-09-04T10:46:29 target -> bentley
I dmaul general coder answers

2020-09-04T10:46:30 target -> bentley
not a cryptor

2020-09-04T10:46:38 bentley -> target
Yes, but so is a cryptor.

2020-09-04T10:46:51 target -> bentley
i.e. for the way the eche works on the runtime

2020-09-04T10:46:54 target -> bentley
responds and crypter?

2020-09-04T10:46:56 bentley -> target
there's also a nuance that the loader loads the BC

2020-09-04T10:46:57 target -> bentley
in terms of the stickiness of the

2020-09-04T10:47:04 bentley -> target
More coder

2020-09-04T10:47:20 target -> bentley
got it

2020-09-04T10:47:23 target -> bentley
So we'll take the bk.

2020-09-04T10:47:25 target -> bentley
give to the crypts

2020-09-04T10:47:28 target -> bentley
get 17 files

2020-09-04T10:47:32 target -> bentley
and by some criteria.

2020-09-04T10:47:35 target -> bentley
looking for the best cryptor

2020-09-04T10:47:37 target -> bentley
which will suit

2020-09-04T10:47:39 target -> bentley
and that's it

2020-09-04T10:47:45 bentley -> target
Yes.

2020-09-04T10:47:47 target -> bentley
we have 17 "deplays"

2020-09-04T10:48:08 bentley -> target
Well... Stern has only 1 Deployment.

2020-09-04T10:48:15 target -> bentley
))

2020-09-04T10:48:21 target -> bentley
I told you figuratively.

2020-09-04T10:48:21 bentley -> target
Extra Class Cryptor

2020-09-04T10:48:26 target -> bentley
clearly

2020-09-04T10:48:30 target -> bentley
we have

2020-09-04T10:48:32 target -> bentley
17 people

2020-09-04T10:48:34 target -> bentley
ready to make crypts

2020-09-04T10:48:37 target -> bentley
various

2020-09-04T10:48:39 target -> bentley
Of these, the following must be selected

2020-09-04T10:48:40 target -> bentley
best

2020-09-04T10:49:04 target -> bentley
so give the file
they will be contacted
they will make the crypts
I will pay
they'll issue them
and we'll test them.
The best ones we'll keep for later work.

2020-09-04T10:49:18 target -> bentley
you have to check them to the maximum to be able to work with their crypts

2020-09-04T10:49:23 bentley -> target
It's simple. Do each crypt and see 1. Workability for 7 10 2019 and detects for def + corp av

2020-09-04T10:49:34 target -> bentley
come on

2020-09-04T10:49:35 target -> bentley
great

2020-09-04T10:49:44 target -> bentley
Only it's better for tomorrow.

2020-09-04T10:49:50 target -> bentley
Because my office is all clogged up.

2020-09-04T10:49:53 bentley -> target
Ok what time?

2020-09-04T10:50:01 target -> bentley
What time is convenient

2020-09-04T10:50:06 target -> bentley
you can give the files for now

2020-09-04T10:50:08 target -> bentley
not all cryptors are online

2020-09-04T10:50:11 target -> bentley
Somebody's gonna do it now.

2020-09-04T10:50:12 bentley -> target
16-17

2020-09-04T10:50:13 target -> bentley
someone at night

2020-09-04T10:50:16 target -> bentley
Yeah come on okay

2020-09-04T10:50:22 target -> bentley
And you mean 1 more person

2020-09-04T10:50:23 target -> bentley
give yes?

2020-09-04T10:50:23 bentley -> target
Ok

2020-09-04T10:50:24 target -> bentley
to help

2020-09-04T10:50:30 bentley -> target
YES of course.

2020-09-04T10:50:36 target -> bentley
I'm telling you right now - people don't know what the fuck to do.
can you teach them?

2020-09-04T10:50:40 bentley -> target
You can 2 I will explain everything to them

2020-09-04T10:50:53 target -> bentley
Okay, then you can take them away, too.

2020-09-04T10:50:54 target -> bentley
help later

2020-09-04T10:50:57 target -> bentley
as testers

2020-09-04T10:51:04 target -> bentley
There are 5 of them, they are just on different tasks.

2020-09-04T10:51:07 bentley -> target
I've taught a lot of progers and I.T. guys.) I even taught my grandmothers how to use a computer back in the day.)

2020-09-04T10:51:14 target -> bentley
But not for all, but for my tasks to help

2020-09-04T10:51:26 target -> bentley
)) I see where you get your patience from.

2020-09-04T10:51:40 bentley -> target
2 - ok for this volume and cars you need at least 6 for each

2020-09-04T10:51:52 bentley -> target
2 sets of 7 10 2019

2020-09-04T10:52:13 bentley -> target
This is ideal. but we can start with 1 set each and I'll take my test 2 sets

2020-09-04T10:52:56 target -> bentley
Write a list of cars

2020-09-04T10:52:57 target -> bentley
which ones do you need

2020-09-04T10:52:59 target -> bentley
and quantity

2020-09-04T10:53:21 target -> bentley
6 cars
2 each from 7, 10, 2019

2020-09-04T10:53:22 target -> bentley
right?

2020-09-04T10:53:33 bentley -> target
yes it is

2020-09-04T10:53:40 bentley -> target
full winds up

2020-09-04T10:53:46 bentley -> target
without russian language at all

2020-09-04T10:55:13 target -> bentley
yes

2020-09-04T10:55:14 target -> bentley
got it

2020-09-04T10:55:15 target -> bentley
will be done by tomorrow

2020-09-04T10:55:31 target -> bentley
give me the file

2020-09-04T10:55:33 target -> bentley
which crypto

2020-09-04T10:55:36 target -> bentley
and crypto nuances

2020-09-04T10:55:39 target -> bentley
kind of note for cryptors

2020-09-04T10:55:54 target -> bentley
in 2008 they had to crypt zeus like this and spy some other way

2020-09-04T10:55:58 target -> bentley
I don't know what's changed now.

2020-09-04T10:56:07 bentley -> target
Deploy will write back later on the nuances

2020-09-04T10:56:21 bentley -> target

were you able to dock with him at 4:00 p.m.

2020-09-05T15:24:35 target -> bentley
Because I'm an hour late.

2020-09-05T15:24:37 bentley -> target
As far as I know he found 1 cryptor for space money

2020-09-05T15:24:41 target -> bentley
and mine made him a list of all the cryptors from the forums

2020-09-05T15:24:53 bentley -> target
100 bucks for a regular creep

2020-09-05T15:24:56 target -> bentley
did he show you the list? 17 people

2020-09-05T15:25:02 target -> bentley
well that's expensive

2020-09-05T15:25:07 bentley -> target
Yes others say in the offa

2020-09-05T15:25:14 target -> bentley
Weekend

2020-09-05T15:25:20 bentley -> target
Yes It must be a unic.

2020-09-05T15:25:29 target -> bentley
is that a publick for 100?)

2020-09-05T15:25:31 bentley -> target
for 100 bucks Deploy makes armor-piercing unics

2020-09-05T15:25:43 bentley -> target
yes

2020-09-05T15:25:53 target -> bentley
so let's pay him) if he can do for 100

2020-09-05T15:26:02 target -> bentley
You're a dickhead.

2020-09-05T15:26:03 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:26:17 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:26:18 target -> bentley
rest

2020-09-05T15:26:21 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:26:23 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:26:31 target -> bentley
of those who left their contacts mentioned or tops

2020-09-05T15:26:50 target -> bentley
Well, maybe a couple were missed.

2020-09-05T15:27:14 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:29:35 bentley -> target
Aren't we going to train today? Testers

2020-09-05T15:29:49 target -> bentley
That's how I called them to help you.

2020-09-05T15:29:53 target -> bentley
check everything

2020-09-05T15:30:02 target -> bentley
they already take the ehe and check everything like you asked

2020-09-05T15:30:23 bentley -> target
So you don't need my help?

2020-09-05T15:30:26 bentley -> target
Or what?

2020-09-05T15:30:44 target -> bentley
I told you since there are no crypts

2020-09-05T15:30:47 target -> bentley
then go rest of course

2020-09-05T15:30:50 target -> bentley
I thought that of the 17 people

2020-09-05T15:30:55 target -> bentley
At least 5-7 people will do

2020-09-05T15:31:02 target -> bentley
threw 300 to an acquaintance of ours

2020-09-05T15:31:05 target -> bentley
To make him pay

2020-09-05T15:31:15 target -> bentley
but came an hour later than planned.

2020-09-05T15:31:20 target -> bentley
and there are 0 crypts since lunch

2020-09-05T15:32:37 bentley -> target
Yeah. Got it. In the future, I'll ask Deploy if he can crypt over the weekend for bits. For example unics on Sunday night to start work in the morning on Mon.

2020-09-05T15:32:45 target -> bentley
see

2020-09-05T15:32:49 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:32:56 target -> bentley
we distributed them

2020-09-05T15:33:06 target -> bentley
1 tests the echo

2020-09-05T15:33:13 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:33:20 target -> bentley
the other mounts in the bk on the coba

2020-09-05T15:33:27 target -> bentley
the third one helps him with bk and coba

2020-09-05T15:33:36 target -> bentley
two more didn't get involved in the end

2020-09-05T15:33:42 target -> bentley
I was told I don't need more.

2020-09-05T15:34:05 bentley -> target
I see.

2020-09-05T15:34:06 target -> bentley
I'm going to throw in for beer anyway.

2020-09-05T15:34:17 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:34:24 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:34:29 target -> bentley
elementary

2020-09-05T15:34:30 target -> bentley
took the echo

2020-09-05T15:34:31 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:34:33 target -> bentley
gave you the report

2020-09-05T15:34:40 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:34:54 bentley -> target

2020-09-05T15:35:08 target -> bentley
gett info?

2020-09-05T15:35:12 bentley -> target
yes

2020-09-05T15:35:35 target -> bentley
this will be done by the second

2020-09-05T15:35:38 target -> bentley
do you want to do it yourself?

2020-09-05T15:35:51 bentley -> target
no better a dedicated person for that

2020-09-05T15:35:59 target -> bentley
here's

2020-09-05T15:36:12 bentley -> target
Yep

2020-09-05T15:36:28 target -> bentley
1 - checks the file after outputting it to av and if ok, uploads it to ftp
2 - get info and command to fetch coba
3 - helps the second

2020-09-05T15:36:36 target -> bentley
I'm not depriving you of beer, don't worry.

2020-09-05T15:36:41 bentley -> target

2020-09-05T15:36:49 bentley -> target

2020-09-05T15:36:55 bentley -> target
That's right.

2020-09-05T15:37:05 target -> bentley
but of course I would like the first one to get a clean file with at least some basic tests

2020-09-05T15:37:26 bentley -> target
On the clear, I test before issuing

2020-09-05T15:37:40 bentley -> target
and it runs it through 2 rounds.

2020-09-05T15:37:49 bentley -> target
Does it make sense to do two runs?

2020-09-05T15:38:00 target -> bentley
you're more likely to check

2020-09-05T15:38:00 target -> bentley
on the off

2020-09-05T15:38:01 target -> bentley
and errors

2020-09-05T15:38:08 target -> bentley
and it will just be on av hands

2020-09-05T15:38:13 target -> bentley
because autotests are bullshit after all

2020-09-05T15:38:13 bentley -> target
+ autotests on corp av on ours.

2020-09-05T15:38:18 target -> bentley
made autotests like bouza's

2020-09-05T15:38:23 target -> bentley
ended up with one of the tear-offs there.

2020-09-05T15:38:24 bentley -> target
aah

2020-09-05T15:38:26 target -> bentley
The other one does not show

2020-09-05T15:38:31 target -> bentley
I thought fuck it all

2020-09-05T15:38:37 target -> bentley
1 person and that's it

2020-09-05T15:38:39 bentley -> target
Booza is always tweaking them and finishing them up.

2020-09-05T15:38:46 target -> bentley
he has nothing else to do but poke and stare at avs

2020-09-05T15:38:59 bentley -> target
Yeah, that's a varick too. Plus download from Browser link

2020-09-05T15:39:07 target -> bentley
yes

2020-09-05T15:39:09 target -> bentley
and it's better

2020-09-05T15:39:11 target -> bentley
Than all these autotests

2020-09-05T15:39:16 target -> bentley
personally for 1 eche at least

2020-09-05T15:39:24 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T15:39:44 target -> bentley

Here's a taste

2020-09-05T16:40:59 target -> bentley

2020-09-05T16:41:00 target -> bentley
yes

something there ponetre complained about the trick I remember

2020-09-08T06:56:25 target -> bentley
What it ends up being

2020-09-08T06:57:37 bentley -> target
Hi. Trick was cleaned halfway through last week and yesterday. We'll see how it goes today. Hof says he kinda did.

2020-09-08T06:57:41 bentley -> target
Well, yes, it's very fast.

2020-09-08T06:57:54 target -> bentley
I see, so it's not an option.

2020-09-08T06:57:59 target -> bentley
does it work all right?

2020-09-08T06:59:16 bentley -> target
So after his hard work it all went down. So last week and the week before that I downloaded

2020-09-08T07:56:37 bentley -> target
<buza> actually this list of names should be expanded, because what I saw, it will give such detects

[11:01:48] <target> it was checked specially
[11:01:52] <buza> yes, I got it, but we can't give this file to slave

2020-09-08T08:00:20 target -> bentley
[11:02:06] <buza> about the name is clear - apparently, the stub is spammed by crypt, if your script worked with the combat name

2020-09-08T08:02:37 bentley -> target
I think Deploy had a few stubs.

2020-09-08T08:06:13 target -> bentley
I need the testers to not just sit in the office
Give them 2-3 files to check around

2020-09-08T08:06:38 bentley -> target
Yeah, I'll give it to you right now.

2020-09-08T08:24:55 bentley -> target
Crowdstrike is definitely needed. One of the biggest

2020-09-08T08:25:05 target -> bentley
not for service, but for friendship.
you can videotape the whole installation
from the beginning of the link to download the installation and update (inside) and turn on all the protections

for each of the AVs a complete instruction manual
so that those who don't understand nicha can put them all

2020-09-08T08:25:29 bentley -> target
Deploy also asks about Van's source code tests

2020-09-08T08:25:29 bentley -> target
When was this checked? When the server was not working from where the bk was loading? Or when everything was already working?

2020-09-08T08:27:42 bentley -> target
On setting up the copr av. Ideally give me access to the machines where it was installed. There are still some AVs with a web interface

2020-09-08T08:28:40 target -> bentley
I'll give you all the dots.
But I want the ori to learn how to set themselves

2020-09-08T08:28:44 target -> bentley

2020-09-08T08:28:47 target -> bentley
Otherwise you don't tune in that way.

2020-09-08T08:28:53 target -> bentley
Especially every 2 weeks to change all the servers

2020-09-08T08:29:22 bentley -> target
Ok. Then the new servers and I'll record a video of the setup

2020-09-08T08:32:34 bentley -> target
BK's admins are up. Write to Booza about the accesses.

2020-09-08T08:45:32 bentley -> target
Are you going to have temporary faces on all the avs?

2020-09-08T08:48:40 target -> bentley
yes

2020-09-08T08:48:44 target -> bentley
That's why every 2 weeks they raise everything

2020-09-08T08:48:46 target -> bentley
over

2020-09-08T08:48:47 target -> bentley

2020-09-09T12:52:55 bentley -> target

2020-09-09T12:59:51 target -> bentley
how to make

2020-09-09T12:59:52 target -> bentley
Give me

2020-09-09T12:59:54 target -> bentley

yes

2020-09-09T13:00:38 target -> bentley

only the check is busy

2020-09-09T13:00:43 bentley -> target
)I'm going to fill it in.

2020-09-09T13:00:58 bentley -> target
oho

2020-09-09T13:01:22 target -> bentley
If you can find something for them to do, then fine.

2020-09-09T13:01:30 target -> bentley
but in my opinion

2020-09-09T13:01:34 target -> bentley
This is the ideal number of people

2020-09-09T13:01:37 target -> bentley
Considering that the file may be random

2020-09-09T13:01:40 target -> bentley
re-check

2020-09-09T13:01:43 target -> bentley
keep an eye on ftp

2020-09-09T13:02:29 bentley -> target
The main thing is to adjust the flow of fresh files from our side, then everything will go well and they will be busy

2020-09-10T13:28:50 target -> bentley

2 days is very short. It used to be 3.

2020-09-11T13:22:36 bentley -> target
The second file is also blocked by the smart

2020-09-11T13:27:50 bentley -> target
I seem to be able to stream the files. Nine are still on the test. I propose next week to kick it up a notch. So the new cert doesn't die over the weekend.

2020-09-11T13:30:06 target -> bentley

There is a peculiarity that if several groups are knocking from the same car, then 1 is remembered and all the others are knocking with it. If you do not delete the bot

2020-09-16T11:39:42 target -> bentley
there's a fuckload of them.

2020-09-16T11:39:58 bentley -> target
Why did you decide not to use the BC?

2020-09-16T11:40:16 target -> bentley
[15.09.2020 23:52:38] <target> no questions for bentley - he tries after that conversation
[15.09.2020 23:53:29] <stern (partner)> we'll improve the system

2020-09-16T11:40:27 target -> bentley

2020-09-16T11:40:59 target -> bentley
did I ask for clean software?

2020-09-16T11:41:00 target -> bentley
yes

2020-09-16T11:41:05 bentley -> target
Yes

2020-09-16T11:41:08 target -> bentley
Why do they give me software with 9 rantimes?

2020-09-16T11:41:23 target -> bentley
you close it with instructions

2020-09-16T11:41:24 target -> bentley
by task

2020-09-16T11:41:26 target -> bentley
did he give you an instruction?

2020-09-16T11:41:29 target -> bentley
check everywhere and everything

2020-09-16T11:41:33 target -> bentley

Do you want to blame it all on the deplot?

2020-09-16T14:22:06 bentley -> target
I've read everything. Checked the uncrypted one on Dinchek, the statics are clean at all, the dynamics are much better than the crypta:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/2bd5751861ec52478189ceb09131cdc5

Detect on Avira immediately, as if static, I do not do anything for the first 2 minutes.
The other two detects - I do not know what to do with them, and they are even without pictures. Maybe so - paranoia. Basic AVs are clean.
Tried to check uncrypted on autotest. Semantec, Avast, Webroot something did not start, the rest went fine. Under Defender and so every day I check manually.
Something has changed in crypt. It started copying itself to Internet cache folder.

2020-09-16T16:26:01 target -> bentley
without double-checking the Iles or waiting for us to report back in 10 minutes what is wrong with the file

2020-09-16T16:26:02 target -> bentley
get the point?

2020-09-16T16:26:25 bentley -> target
I thought after the break and you writing the software and hiring helpers that it was their responsibility

2020-09-16T16:26:39 target -> bentley
so

2020-09-16T16:26:40 target -> bentley
you stern

2020-09-16T16:26:42 target -> bentley
should not write at all

2020-09-16T16:26:45 target -> bentley

2020-09-16T16:31:35 target -> bentley
Because the bk got screwed up.

2020-09-16T16:31:42 target -> bentley

Required skills
- Ability to identify and describe a problem in software
- Discipline, responsibility

Responsibilities
- testing of internal products

Terms

<buza> well, it turns out it's about pads
[18:03:08] <buza> nothing else
[18:03:39] <bentley> Yeah.
[18:03:50] <buza> well wait for green
[18:03:57] <buza> let's not work without domains yet
[18:04:11] <buza> since what's the use of stealing cryptos if they don't knock anyway
[18:04:12] <bentley> already kinda gave out van and mashroom
[18:05:20] <buza> [14:04:32] <buza> green didn't give out domains? [14:04:59] <ajrec> no
[18:06:05] <bentley> And with unic ipi pads?
[18:06:18] <buza> it's bullshit
[18:06:22] <bentley> Or just waiting for sl domains?
[18:06:38] <buza> bounces on raw addresses with no signs of domain work immediately set up a firewall
[18:06:54] <bentley> I'll write to Target

[14:24:12] <target> i thought you'd break like all these weak faggots
you don't know how to fuck your coders, you respect them, maybe it's right

2020-10-02T10:21:45 target -> bentley
still?

2020-10-02T10:21:46 bentley -> target
As far as I know in BC we have this algorithm

2020-10-02T10:21:53 bentley -> target
Roma don't know

2020-10-02T10:21:58 target -> bentley
roma has amazon stands

Listen, you're a head.

2020-10-02T10:22:11 bentley -> target
I could be wrong, but Van never gave me an answer to this question yesterday.

2020-10-02T10:22:18 target -> bentley
it's true hacker dns it should also be on the blacklist

2020-10-02T10:22:33 bentley -> target
Of course, when it was burned, it flew in batches.

2020-10-02T10:23:01 bentley -> target
and the mechanism of work - receiving via eMercoin. But it is not exact now I will ask Buza

2020-10-02T10:25:11 bentley -> target
<bentley> tell me, do we have any emercoin dns left in BC?
[17:23:44] <buza> yes, as a reserve
[17:23:54] <buza> it's not used if the main pads work
[17:24:09] <buza> it's only for the case when a very important bot failed because of dead pads

[17:30:50] <pulyamaster@xabber.org> it didn't seem to take a week

2020-10-02T10:33:19 target -> bentley
He'll be giving out another 7 grand for a year.

2020-10-02T14:11:53 bentley -> target
<bentley> Looks like Target needs to write a whole new BC since it's not working for us and Boer is knocking
[20:47:46] <bentley> https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1310843235229671424
[20:48:04] <bentley> about our loader bazaar
[20:50:48] <buza> advertising)
[20:50:55] <buza> Of those, 7 started as FUD. The other 4 started at either 1 or 2 detections.
[20:51:15] <bentley> https://twitter.com/search?q=MUSTER%20PLUS%20SP%20Z%20O%20O&src=typed_query
[20:51:24] <bentley> That's who signed the cert today
[20:52:00] <buza> well, since food, it turns out that the quality of testing we have excellent
[20:52:02] <buza> and stealth
[20:52:06] <buza> but why the bitch is no tapping)
[20:52:13] <bentley> here's dz ))
[20:52:34] <buza> I'm talking to boer, it's easier
[20:52:46] <buza> no special tricks with pads and protocols
[20:53:30] <buza> our favorite Vitaly Kremez is there by the way)
[20:53:39] <buza> it's our personal analyst
[20:53:46] <bentley> Ahh )))
[20:53:49] <bentley> Special for us
[20:54:11] <buza> you see how fast they work
[20:54:16] <buza> in the morning in the paper, in the evening in the verse
[20:54:21] <buza> and on the boer find
[20:54:36] <bentley> I don't know how to search.)
[20:54:41] <buza> and how did you find it?
[20:54:55] <bentley> I was looking for the certificate firm
[20:55:10] <buza> but the certificate is the same for them
[20:55:27] <bentley> It doesn't stain, it means
[20:55:57] <bentley> or it's different
[20:56:00] <buza> according to the targeting, it sticks more
[20:59:20] <bentley> it seems we are much more dangerous and there is a big trail behind us so they cut us down right away
[20:59:36] <buza> any idea why
[20:59:45] <buza> just can't believe that technology reached such a progress)
[20:59:49] <buza> I mean why we get chopped
[21:00:08] <bentley> Why?
[21:00:16] <buza> some signatures in the protocol
[21:00:23] <buza> by uri
[21:01:08] <bentley> Can we fix it?
[21:01:34] <buza> we always have /api/vtotam in uri
[21:01:42] <buza> if only that, yes
[21:01:44] <buza> and even easy
[21:01:58] <buza> and even in principle today if mashroom with cactus
[21:02:07] <bentley> aah about the address where the download is coming from
[21:02:20] <bentley> you can do 1 test build
[21:02:33] <buza> well the url looks like this
https://11.22.33.44/api/version
[21:02:57] <bentley> api version
[21:03:11] <buza> I assume that firewalls can get hooked on this url - we've been in operation for a long time, it hasn't been changed since start, i.e. read half a year

[21:03:18] <buza> and it could have already hit all the bases
[21:03:25] <bentley> yes
[21:03:30] <buza> but to do that, you need to promote ssl-traffic
[21:03:42] <buza> and it's not a trivial task even for DPI-devices
[21:04:10] <bentley> apparently resources allow
[21:04:55] <buza> command mashroom with cactus
[21:05:11] <buza> go into their groups and change the prefixes to something random but short
[21:05:21] <bentley> yeah
[21:05:26] <buza> change them every day
[21:05:44] <bentley> ok
[21:06:37] <bentley> so there will be no /api/version right?
[21:06:42] <buza> no
[21:06:46] <buza> get rid of those strings
[21:06:54] <buza> but they don't really affect anything, they were chosen for masking

You mean cryptors?

2020-10-07T13:37:45 bentley -> target
<bentley> another question on Target. You said that this week there will be a change in the protocol for working with the admin
[19:36:56] <bentley> and also as an option to improve encryption
[19:37:24] <bentley> a lot of time to do it? can't be done by tomorrow?
[19:38:10] <buza> I'll find out and tell you
[19:39:26] <bentley> I got it that when we change the next day it works perfectly and during the day 2 avers will calculate the algorithm and again we have a problem with the file
[19:40:55] <buza> today we tried to implement the second part
[19:41:05] <buza> but we should check it today
[19:41:18] <bentley> of course we will
[19:54:49] <buza> well, yeah, let's roll it out
[19:54:56] <buza> both cactus and mashroom say they're ready
[19:54:58] <buza> on the server we pumped
[19:55:08] <bentley> well let's test it then

2020-10-07T13:38:26 target -> bentley
Yeah, or else he fucking writes

2020-10-07T13:38:27 target -> bentley

Knock yourself out

2020-10-07T13:39:31 target -> bentley
find out how much it costs

2020-10-07T13:39:34 target -> bentley

2020-10-07T13:39:34 bentley -> target
What to say?

2020-10-07T13:39:37 target -> bentley
and whether defecting his dock

2020-10-07T13:39:43 bentley -> target
150 and within 2-3 hours

2020-10-07T13:39:54 target -> bentley
well is the file clean? or does def fuck it up

2020-10-07T13:40:00 bentley -> target
No it doesn't usually stink. Been working with it for a long time.

2020-10-07T13:40:03 bentley -> target

From 12 usually

2020-10-07T13:42:29 target -> bentley
tomorrow we need assemblies with the designation doc1
let's see how it works
put these files in the dock
and run it a couple of times

2020-10-07T13:42:35 target -> bentley
And the main thing is the certificates

2020-10-07T13:42:56 bentley -> target
clearly

2020-10-07T13:43:30 target -> bentley
will you do it?

2020-10-07T13:43:41 target -> bentley
To have a bot build with dock1

2020-10-07T13:43:45 target -> bentley
negotiate with this one as well

2020-10-07T13:43:52 bentley -> target

2020-10-07T13:44:37 target -> bentley

2020-10-07T13:44:44 target -> bentley
Let them make a purely dockable build
to1

2020-10-07T13:44:47 target -> bentley
and this exe

2020-10-07T13:44:47 target -> bentley

2020-10-07T13:44:57 target -> bentley

2020-10-07T13:45:06 target -> bentley
