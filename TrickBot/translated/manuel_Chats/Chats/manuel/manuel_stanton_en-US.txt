[17.09.21 14:43:58] stanton: It actually emulates everything
[17.09.21 14:44:06] manuel: Yeah.
[17.09.21 14:44:17] stanton: After startup it checks memory
[17.09.21 14:44:40] stanton: after some time
[17.09.21 14:44:59] manuel: every 5 seconds apparently
[17.09.21 14:45:00] stanton: It doesn't block the dll because it doesn't know who launched it, maybe
[17.09.21 14:45:30] stanton: My idea is to disassemble shellcode and put noise in it
[17.09.21 14:46:01] manuel: Manufacturing new shk?
[17.09.21 14:46:08] stanton: Yeah
[17.09.21 14:46:19] manuel: How do you do that?
[17.09.21 14:46:20] stanton: automatically maybe
[17.09.21 14:46:54] stanton: at least for small
[17.09.21 14:47:11] manuel: Let's try if you can do it
[17.09.21 14:47:36] stanton: we can do the shk, but then we have to remove the code sharply
[17.09.21 14:48:00] stanton: clean up memory - it might work now
[17.09.21 14:49:46] stanton: the question is who needs it
[17.09.21 14:49:49] stanton: ?
[17.09.21 14:49:59] stanton: so you can try to disassemble
[17.09.21 14:50:07] manuel: I can
[17.09.21 14:50:32] stanton: if it works, it'll last for a long time
[17.09.21 14:50:41] manuel: Let's try it
[17.09.21 14:58:39] stanton: In short, preliminary - you need no open data - strings in shk. We need buffers to be generated dynamically by code.
[17.09.21 14:58:58] stanton: Even obfuscated
[17.09.21 14:59:19] stanton: We can't change them
[17.09.21 14:59:23] stanton: Though I don't know.

[20.09.21 13:02:45] manuel: Shall we make cryptos?
