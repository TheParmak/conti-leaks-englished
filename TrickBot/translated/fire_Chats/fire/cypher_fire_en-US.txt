[11/01/21 20:57:11] cypher: Look how it turned out, I was given a test assignment, but since it was the weekend - no one was there. I looked around to see what the firm was, etc., but I didn't unload anything. There were questions. When I checked in with him on Monday, it turned out abruptly that I had to now, that I had to be at a planning meeting. I had plans, there was no time limit. I unloaded, poured everything in, asked - look? In reply - be at the meeting. Ok, I paid the movers a delay, stayed, at 17 wrote back - silence. All right, went on business. I arrived - the answer was only at 17:30. Well, okay, went into a chat room, and in fact, there was nothing discussed, and the point of this meeting was not.
And they wrote to me as if I was doing me a favor in the hiring, and in the chat there are people who are far from OSINT at all :)
That's why I want to discuss all the nuances with the one who controls the situation, so that I don't waste my time if things are not clear.
[01.11.21 21:01:15] fire: Well, in this respect, the questions to @bio

[08.11.21 22:15:15] cypher: 1. Password choice.
The password on the archive is complex. The password must contain: Capital letters, upper case letters, numbers, special symbols. The password must be 16 characters or longer.
An example of such a password: q%KOCBTK2T9~nO8V (DO NOT USE THIS!!!)
Various generators can be used to generate such passwords. Just type in google - online password generator. Once generated - add more characters, letters and numbers from yourself.

2. file names. Name the archive with a simple letter and number. The extension is .rar.
Example archives: 1c.rar, 6y.rar, 9u.rar.
You must also call the file inside the archive with a simple name. For example: 1w.txt, 0y.txt.
The name of the archive and the name of the file must be different.

3. do not give the reports you make to third parties. If such a fact is revealed - dismissal, without severance pay! If you want to show someone an example of work, then make a report from scratch.
