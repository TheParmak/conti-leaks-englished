Not using my kits yet? There's a version 107 loaded there, and this one is already 112.

2020-06-29T12:02:55 mushroom -> bentley
Another question. Target said to make an error window like dl1 did. What text should I write there? Is it the same?

2020-06-29T12:07:42 bentley -> mushroom
Yeah, same here.

2020-06-29T12:07:51 bentley -> mushroom

2020-06-29T12:08:22 mushroom -> bentley

Test. To show the window only when you start it yourself, when you start it via mount it should not show the window, for example after reboot it should start itself without the window.

2020-06-29T14:46:17 bentley -> mushroom
Okay

2020-06-30T10:32:07 mushroom -> bentley
Hi. Have you tested with the loader window?

2020-06-30T10:33:09 bentley -> mushroom
Yes. It works. The only thing I didn't understand was why it didn't bounce in the alminka

2020-06-30T10:33:47 mushroom -> bentley
Did you replace the bot in the admin?

2020-06-30T10:34:43 bentley -> mushroom
Lauder?

2020-06-30T10:34:50 bentley -> mushroom

2020-06-30T13:27:03 mushroom -> bentley
I'm back. There was no light.

2020-06-30T13:27:36 mushroom -> bentley
Was updating the bot in the admin, there was a 107 version there yesterday, with the addresses not working.

2020-06-30T13:31:42 bentley -> mushroom

2020-06-30T13:32:29 mushroom -> bentley
I meant have you updated?

2020-06-30T13:33:58 mushroom -> bentley
If you have not updated, update what I sent yesterday, I think that's why there was no bounce when you tested the loader with the window.

2020-06-30T13:39:57 bentley -> mushroom
got it

2020-07-02T07:53:02 mushroom -> bentley
Hi. Have you updated the bot in the admin my? Does it work with the loader, with the window?

2020-07-02T07:58:30 bentley -> mushroom

More to do for accumulation?

2020-07-03T07:51:33 bentley -> mushroom

I have this question. You sent me a new loeder it also has an error window? And it also needs to be loaded in the control panel. But when it is loaded then after the reboot will also come out an error window?

2020-07-07T10:35:34 mushroom -> bentley
The new loader also has an error window. There shouldn't be an error window after reloading, only when you double-click it yourself.

2020-07-07T10:38:52 bentley -> mushroom
Got it.

2020-07-07T10:39:20 mushroom -> bentley
And what was the window with the tshibbek after you rebooted?

2020-07-07T10:39:34 bentley -> mushroom
No. It's just that I've been ducking something.

2020-07-07T10:40:14 mushroom -> bentley
And when it updates itself to a new version, there shouldn't be a window unless it's run by double-clicking.

2020-07-07T10:40:24 bentley -> mushroom

2020-07-07T10:50:43 bentley -> mushroom

All versions? Have you tried other compilers. Clang is the cleanest you can get.

2020-07-07T10:52:52 bentley -> mushroom
Okay. Let's give it a try.

2020-07-07T10:55:25 mushroom -> bentley
Is it the MSVC lowrider? What bit rate?

2020-07-07T10:56:28 bentley -> mushroom
Yes. 64

2020-07-07T10:56:43 bentley -> mushroom
Now I'm going to test 1 more crypt

2020-07-07T10:56:55 mushroom -> bentley
Clang try it.

It fails within a minute after launching.
We've done several different crypts and it's still blowing up.
And i signed with blank cert too. Didn't help.

2020-07-07T15:17:29 mushroom -> bentley
Does it stink without the certificate? Cert is written on the end.

2020-07-07T15:18:00 bentley -> mushroom
Yes.

2020-07-07T15:18:04 bentley -> mushroom
I'll check again.

2020-07-07T15:21:37 mushroom -> bentley
And another question, what file or program is specified in this det?

2020-07-07T15:35:45 bentley -> mushroom
I've already rolled it back.

2020-07-07T15:43:24 bentley -> mushroom
Weird. It's all clear now.

2020-07-07T15:43:29 bentley -> mushroom
2 cars looked at.

2020-07-07T15:46:16 mushroom -> bentley
Certificate?

2020-07-07T15:46:53 bentley -> mushroom
Both with and without certificate both knock and do not detect

2020-07-07T15:47:33 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe he remembered the file name from the previous check.

2020-07-07T15:47:49 bentley -> mushroom
Maybe

2020-07-07T15:47:51 mushroom -> bentley
But you're always rolling back.

2020-07-07T15:48:07 bentley -> mushroom
Yes.

2020-07-07T15:48:13 bentley -> mushroom
 Maybe it didn't roll back just

2020-07-07T15:48:25 mushroom -> bentley
Is there such a thing?

2020-07-07T15:48:30 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-07T15:48:34 bentley -> mushroom
but rarely

2020-07-07T15:48:49 mushroom -> bentley
Probably because of that.

2020-07-07T15:49:07 bentley -> mushroom

Hi. How does group 8 work?

2020-07-24T07:50:46 bentley -> mushroom
Hi. Haven't worked yet. Talar is redoing the admins. Buza said that the bot test status should work the first time the bot loads into the admin.

2020-07-24T07:51:06 bentley -> mushroom
And it doesn't work. BC only works in Production status

2020-07-24T07:51:31 mushroom -> bentley
Making a new build?

2020-07-24T07:51:47 bentley -> mushroom
Yes. Do it, please. Maybe it'll work today.

2020-07-24T07:52:06 mushroom -> bentley
No change.

2020-07-24T08:00:34 bentley -> mushroom
You don't have to do it if there is no change.

2020-07-24T13:48:49 mushroom -> bentley
I'll take a look at it now.

2020-07-24T13:50:29 mushroom -> bentley
Do you have any logs?

2020-07-24T13:50:40 bentley -> mushroom
I'm about to run with the logs.

2020-07-24T13:53:43 mushroom -> bentley
Bug. On the server, probably. I'm getting the updater version 129, and the file size is 4 bytes.

2020-07-24T13:54:07 mushroom -> bentley
And the latest version is 131.

2020-07-24T13:54:23 mushroom -> bentley
Update the loeder on the server and try again.

2020-07-24T13:54:45 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-07-24T13:55:44 mushroom -> bentley
This one comes \E^\ instead of a file.

2020-07-24T13:56:59 bentley -> mushroom
Updated

2020-07-24T13:57:20 mushroom -> bentley
I'll check it out now.

2020-07-24T13:58:50 mushroom -> bentley
4 bytes all the same. If I download the loader and if the bot always 4 bytes instead of a file. It's always \E^\.

2020-07-24T13:59:15 mushroom -> bentley
While the version comes correct, now 131, as it should come.

2020-07-24T14:12:49 mushroom -> bentley
after downloading the new GO files! nadimali?

2020-07-24T14:13:24 bentley -> mushroom
Status you mean? From test to production?

2020-07-24T14:13:41 mushroom -> bentley
Ask thalar how to download.

2020-07-24T14:13:50 mushroom -> bentley
What he meant.

2020-07-24T14:14:09 mushroom -> bentley
He's the one asking.

2020-07-24T14:36:23 mushroom -> bentley
So how did thalar explain the new loading?

2020-07-24T14:36:43 mushroom -> bentley
Does it work or should I check?

2020-07-24T14:41:48 bentley -> mushroom
I don't understand it yet.

2020-07-24T14:42:52 mushroom -> bentley
If you need to check it, write what doesn't work.

2020-07-24T14:54:14 bentley -> mushroom
Yes.

2020-07-24T14:54:21 bentley -> mushroom
Until I understood that Talar corrected

2020-07-27T12:16:33 mushroom -> bentley

2020-07-29T14:34:16 bentley -> mushroom
Let's check the crypt now

2020-07-29T14:35:15 mushroom -> bentley
What do you have to do for this test? Or is it only possible to do it one at a time?

2020-07-29T14:35:28 bentley -> mushroom
I'll run it now.

2020-07-29T14:35:40 bentley -> mushroom
I'll put a new one in the BC admin.

2020-07-29T14:36:18 mushroom -> bentley
I'll run it now.

2020-07-29T14:36:18 mushroom -> bentley
I'll put a new one in the admin panel of the BC

2020-07-29T14:36:33 bentley -> mushroom
I will start now.
[21:35:39] <bentley> I'll add a new BC to the admin

2020-07-29T14:37:01 mushroom -> bentley
I mean, I need to check out the seven group, and you're busy.

2020-07-29T14:37:19 bentley -> mushroom
Check on the autotest?

2020-07-29T14:37:40 mushroom -> bentley
Just like you check mine.

2020-07-29T14:38:02 mushroom -> bentley
On antiviruses that shouldn't have detects.

2020-07-29T14:39:10 bentley -> mushroom
These are autotests to begin with, then if there are detections on the autotest, then I look at the car itself with the car on which there was a detection

2020-07-29T14:39:35 bentley -> mushroom
+ still checking on the work of all the commands and fixing

2020-07-29T14:39:45 bentley -> mushroom
on 3 mushrooms 7 10 2019

2020-07-29T14:40:33 mushroom -> bentley
You should at least do an autotest to see the detects. Give it to me right away for revision then.

2020-07-29T14:41:11 mushroom -> bentley
What needs to be done?

2020-07-29T14:41:33 bentley -> mushroom
Now we're going to check your Group 8 crypt

2020-07-29T14:41:37 bentley -> mushroom
and then you can

2020-07-29T14:41:46 bentley -> mushroom
Do you have access to the cryptpanel?

2020-07-29T14:42:04 mushroom -> bentley
Does it take turns there?

2020-07-29T14:42:11 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-29T14:42:20 mushroom -> bentley
I'll keep that in mind.

2020-07-29T15:23:31 bentley -> mushroom
Released except for Yeset.

2020-07-29T15:24:37 mushroom -> bentley
Did mine roll a set?

2020-07-29T15:25:41 bentley -> mushroom
Detects on Yeset, Trend Micro, Sophos.

2020-07-29T15:25:48 bentley -> mushroom
I want to see the eset.

2020-07-29T15:56:02 mushroom -> bentley
If anything on static the cleanest bot is x64 MinGW and x86 Clang. And the cleanest loaders are MSVC x86\x64.

2020-07-29T15:57:01 bentley -> mushroom
The looder is crypted and the bot also put MSVC

2020-07-29T15:57:59 mushroom -> bentley
x64 MinGW and x86 Clang bots I just scanned, got the cleanest. If you need to replace them.

2020-07-29T15:58:41 bentley -> mushroom
Okay

2020-07-30T07:48:44 mushroom -> bentley
Hi. How's my kit working out?

2020-07-30T07:49:07 bentley -> mushroom
Hi

2020-07-30T07:49:20 bentley -> mushroom
It doesn't stick.

2020-07-30T07:49:51 mushroom -> bentley
And the band seven?

2020-07-30T07:50:07 bentley -> mushroom
Haven't gotten around to it yet. We'll do it today.

2020-07-30T07:50:43 mushroom -> bentley
Does it say in the logs that it's fixed?

2020-07-30T07:51:13 bentley -> mushroom
Yes watched the bitsadmin like you said

2020-07-30T07:54:41 mushroom -> bentley
I'll change the method of fixing it.

2020-07-30T07:55:38 mushroom -> bentley
Check out seven. It should be released already.

2020-07-30T07:55:53 bentley -> mushroom
Okay

2020-07-30T11:41:51 mushroom -> bentley
Question for clarification. Is my kit not fixed on all systems? It doesn't lock on both crypto and non-crypto?

2020-07-30T11:42:44 bentley -> mushroom
Right. I tested the crypt yesterday.

2020-07-30T11:42:50 bentley -> mushroom
Let me check the one that is not encrypted.

2020-07-30T11:49:07 mushroom -> bentley
Also to clarify the fixation check bitsadmin /list /verbose

2020-07-30T11:49:47 mushroom -> bentley
Then there will be detailed information, there will be written the path to the file that runs (the loader).

2020-07-30T11:50:29 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-07-30T12:34:41 bentley -> mushroom
10 and 2019 are secured

2020-07-30T12:34:44 bentley -> mushroom
7 - no

2020-07-30T12:35:06 mushroom -> bentley
Is there nothing fixed with the crypt at all?

2020-07-30T12:35:16 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-30T12:35:25 mushroom -> bentley
So that's what it's all about.

2020-07-30T12:35:35 mushroom -> bentley
Win 7 I'm going to have a look at mine now.

2020-07-30T12:35:36 bentley -> mushroom
Re-did it today, I'll check it out then.

2020-07-30T12:35:43 mushroom -> bentley
Do you have logs from WIn 7?

2020-07-30T12:36:07 bentley -> mushroom
So the bk logs?

2020-07-30T12:36:24 mushroom -> bentley
bd2.log and dl2.log

2020-07-30T12:36:38 bentley -> mushroom
No. I ran it without logs.

2020-07-30T12:37:02 mushroom -> bentley
Look there bitsadmin /list /verbose

2020-07-30T12:37:23 mushroom -> bentley
Write here what will be the task of System maintenance

2020-07-30T12:38:02 bentley -> mushroom
I'll send you the result of the team now. I saved it in txt.

2020-07-30T12:38:34 mushroom -> bentley
Go for it.

2020-07-30T12:46:06 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-07-30T12:46:21 mushroom -> bentley
I think I figured it out.

2020-07-30T12:46:59 mushroom -> bentley
Look at the PARENT environment variable

2020-07-30T12:47:31 mushroom -> bentley
Or rename dl2.exe

2020-07-30T12:47:40 mushroom -> bentley
Then it won't get deleted.

2020-07-30T12:48:05 mushroom -> bentley
But it is better to delete the PARENT environment variable

2020-07-30T12:49:34 mushroom -> bentley
Better give me access to Win 7 this one.

Error.

2020-07-30T14:28:27 bentley -> mushroom
Why would that be the case?

2020-07-30T14:28:34 bentley -> mushroom
In the admin panel, I've uploaded everything.

2020-07-30T14:29:12 bentley -> mushroom
That's why Balzac doesn't load.

2020-07-30T14:29:31 mushroom -> bentley
Replace the bot with another one from MSVC or Clang

2020-07-30T14:29:46 mushroom -> bentley
And run it again.

2020-07-30T14:29:47 bentley -> mushroom
but should we keep the same version? 133

2020-07-30T14:29:57 mushroom -> bentley
Yes.

2020-07-30T14:30:04 mushroom -> bentley
They're all 133.

2020-07-30T14:30:10 mushroom -> bentley
Or rather 132

2020-07-30T14:30:41 mushroom -> bentley
It's MinGW there now, some kind of glitch with that compiler.

2020-07-30T14:32:57 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-07-30T14:33:01 bentley -> mushroom
 no error so far

2020-07-30T14:33:44 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe I made a mistake when I compiled and mixed up x86 and x64. For now, that means don't use MinGW.

2020-07-30T14:33:55 bentley -> mushroom
Good tapping.

2020-07-30T14:37:11 bentley -> mushroom
It turns out that if you run loaders earlier they will not knock out or knock out?

2020-07-30T14:37:51 bentley -> mushroom
Halfway through replacing the bot

2020-07-30T14:38:18 mushroom -> bentley
If they get a foothold, they will launch a new bot at the next launch.

2020-07-30T14:38:40 mushroom -> bentley
And they're supposed to get a foothold, it happens at the beginning of the job.

2020-07-30T14:38:52 mushroom -> bentley

Hi. Have you seen the group seven?

2020-07-31T07:54:43 bentley -> mushroom
Hi. No. Yesterday I had a lot of trouble with Balzac. The bots wouldn't knock, the bots didn't all knock, the bots died while working.

2020-07-31T07:55:19 bentley -> mushroom
I will now run the bot again on my machine. Last time it died at the request of the ehe, even though the machine was working

2020-07-31T08:08:21 mushroom -> bentley
There is no signature on the server.

2020-07-31T08:08:33 mushroom -> bentley
All bots will not work.

2020-07-31T08:08:38 bentley -> mushroom
Tough.

2020-07-31T08:08:55 bentley -> mushroom
I'm wondering why it's not knocking. Talar to write?

2020-07-31T08:10:29 mushroom -> bentley
Write to Booze. He does the signing.

2020-07-31T08:11:31 mushroom -> bentley

2020-07-31T08:12:14 mushroom -> bentley

I see.

2020-07-31T08:13:02 mushroom -> bentley
There's no date to sign, only time, and no signature itself.

Regardless of the reboot or just 3 hours have passed.

2020-07-31T12:30:18 bentley -> mushroom
Got it

2020-07-31T12:31:24 mushroom -> bentley
It's easy to check so you don't have to wait 3 hours. After rebooting you can do bitsadmin /list and the BITS system will start and run the job this.

2020-07-31T12:31:46 bentley -> mushroom
Got it

2020-07-31T12:31:53 bentley -> mushroom
It's easier ))

Are you spelling Run bat wrong on purpose?

cd c: dir instead of cd c:\r\ndir\r\n

2020-07-31T12:56:04 bentley -> mushroom

2020-08-04T07:52:33 bentley -> mushroom
Yes.

2020-08-04T07:53:10 bentley -> mushroom
On 7 it worked completely on 10 and 2019 it didn't work at all. And the logs didn't show up.

Hi. The MinGW build didn't work yesterday. Gave out an MSVC build.

2020-08-05T07:54:12 mushroom -> bentley
We don't use MinGW yet.

2020-08-05T07:54:23 mushroom -> bentley
Clang or MSVC.

2020-08-05T07:54:35 bentley -> mushroom
Yeah. I just forgot.

2020-08-05T07:55:30 mushroom -> bentley
The default is MSVC, if there are any problems with it then Clang.

2020-08-05T07:55:38 bentley -> mushroom

Tested Frog yesterday. On 7 and 10 everything is ok. on 2019 it detects after reboot. Criptom does not clean it up.

2020-08-07T08:16:50 mushroom -> bentley
OK. Who to give it to didn't look, or no one yet?

2020-08-07T08:17:19 bentley -> mushroom
I don't know who it is yet. I need to redo it so it doesn't get detected.

2020-08-07T08:17:57 mushroom -> bentley
When it's redone.

2020-08-07T08:18:29 bentley -> mushroom

Says the bot doesn't come to him in Koba

2020-08-17T12:13:28 mushroom -> bentley
Last entry PID: 8948

2020-08-17T12:13:44 mushroom -> bentley
How do you know what works?

2020-08-17T12:13:56 bentley -> mushroom
A bot should appear in his admin area

2020-08-17T12:14:02 bentley -> mushroom
from this ipi

2020-08-17T12:14:23 mushroom -> bentley
If the PID comes, it means it works. 60 seconds only works.

2020-08-17T12:14:38 bentley -> mushroom
What does 60 seconds mean?

2020-08-17T12:14:45 mushroom -> bentley
60 seconds have passed and the process is killed.

2020-08-17T12:14:53 mushroom -> bentley
Timeout 60 seconds.

2020-08-17T12:15:01 mushroom -> bentley
runexe hollowing 60 scvhost service64.exe

2020-08-17T12:15:02 bentley -> mushroom
And after running the eche?

2020-08-17T12:15:27 mushroom -> bentley
Launched exe 60 seconds passed, process killed.

2020-08-17T12:15:46 mushroom -> bentley
Timeout is for that.

2020-08-17T12:16:02 mushroom -> bentley
Run with a long timeout or 0 timeout.

2020-08-17T12:16:13 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-08-17T12:16:31 mushroom -> bentley
Timeout is how long the process should run at most.

2020-08-17T12:16:59 mushroom -> bentley
0 timeout means the process is in the background, it started and we don't touch it anymore.

2020-08-17T12:17:42 bentley -> mushroom
background run yes?

2020-08-17T12:18:02 mushroom -> bentley
That's without the timeout.

2020-08-17T12:18:09 mushroom -> bentley
Yes there will be a 0 timeout.

2020-08-17T12:18:17 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-08-17T12:18:33 mushroom -> bentley
The answer should come back as PID: 1234 backround

2020-08-17T12:18:40 mushroom -> bentley
So it's up and running.

2020-08-17T12:18:56 mushroom -> bentley
If error PID: 0 Msg: < Error code>

2020-08-17T12:20:03 mushroom -> bentley
runexe hollowing 600 scvhost service64.exe

2020-08-17T12:20:16 mushroom -> bentley
So in 10 minutes you'll get an answer.

2020-08-17T12:21:17 mushroom -> bentley
Or rather, in 10 minutes at most an answer will come.

2020-08-17T12:21:46 mushroom -> bentley
If it does not complete itself in 10 minutes, the bot will kill it and come back.

2020-08-17T12:21:52 bentley -> mushroom
So it will run for 10 minutes and then give an answer whether it worked or not?

2020-08-17T12:22:06 mushroom -> bentley
It will run for 10 minutes at most.

2020-08-17T12:23:13 mushroom -> bentley
Which will come sooner, that he himself will finish or 10 minutes, if 10 minutes, then forcibly it will kill the bot and send what he had time to withdraw.

2020-08-17T12:23:46 mushroom -> bentley
Sort of like a timeout on an http request.

2020-08-17T12:23:52 bentley -> mushroom
clearly

2020-08-17T13:24:46 mushroom -> bentley
Strange that even the dll doesn't work, and it just runs from disk.

2020-08-17T13:25:46 mushroom -> bentley
You can also try running Create Process instead of ProcessHollowing.

2020-08-17T13:25:56 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-08-17T13:33:23 mushroom -> bentley
Is there a service64.exe with logs?

2020-08-17T13:33:47 mushroom -> bentley

2020-08-17T13:48:47 bentley -> mushroom
It worked <poll> run background/create process

2020-08-17T13:50:10 mushroom -> bentley
Have you tried running background\hollowing?

2020-08-17T14:02:06 mushroom -> bentley
So is there a service64.exe with logs?

2020-08-17T14:02:27 bentley -> mushroom
No

2020-08-17T14:03:02 mushroom -> bentley
Then it's going to be problematic to figure out what's wrong.

2020-08-17T14:03:45 mushroom -> bentley
Create Process should only be used when all other possibilities to run have failed.

2020-08-17T14:04:13 mushroom -> bentley
This is the scamperiest way (with saving to disk).

2020-08-17T14:04:50 bentley -> mushroom

Hi. There is no signature on the server right now. All bots will not work. Is that the intention?

2020-08-24T07:49:41 bentley -> mushroom
Hi. No, of course not.

Group of seven did not give anyone to work, did they?

2020-08-25T11:32:55 bentley -> mushroom
seven was at Swift's

2020-08-25T11:34:31 mushroom -> bentley
I'm just looking at group 8 and 7 for the bots that are now online from the same address.

2020-08-25T11:35:01 mushroom -> bentley
I don't think they're bots.

2020-08-25T11:35:33 mushroom -> bentley
They send the wrong requests, at least for group 8.

2020-08-25T11:36:37 mushroom -> bentley
Why are there so many of them now? Is someone sending them out now?

2020-08-25T11:42:44 bentley -> mushroom
it started yesterday afternoon or so

2020-08-25T11:49:06 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe it's like researchers.

2020-08-25T11:49:51 mushroom -> bentley
Requests are sent. My bot doesn't send blank queries like these bots do.

2020-08-25T11:50:11 bentley -> mushroom
exactly

2020-08-25T11:50:22 mushroom -> bentley
8 and 7 are sending the same blank requests, and that can't be.

2020-08-25T11:50:49 bentley -> mushroom
So they send by hand or through something else.

2020-08-25T11:50:58 mushroom -> bentley
Yes.

2020-08-25T11:57:58 bentley -> mushroom
Can you tell me if you can see this request in the admin. The empty query you're talking about

2020-08-25T11:58:38 bentley -> mushroom
It's just the bot is empty isn't it?

2020-08-25T11:58:48 mushroom -> bentley
It's just empty.

2020-08-25T11:59:14 mushroom -> bentley
You can see my one here 3019599f7959019011f6b6c3b9dc97ae04a

2020-08-25T11:59:15 bentley -> mushroom
Got it. So that I can distinguish in the future between normal bots and such

2020-08-25T12:00:02 mushroom -> bentley
It makes 3 requests there:
+ Message : Version 0.1 25.08.2020 11:01 done

2020-08-25T12:00:24 mushroom -> bentley
And these ones are empty.

2020-08-25T12:00:35 bentley -> mushroom
Yeah, got it.

2020-08-25T14:01:35 mushroom -> bentley
Write Poll that it's the researchers at group 8 weird bots. You've got him.

2020-08-25T14:02:00 mushroom -> bentley
I don't have it in my contacts.

2020-08-25T14:19:11 bentley -> mushroom

2020-08-25T14:19:16 bentley -> mushroom
on the rest - ok

2020-08-25T14:27:53 mushroom -> bentley
What do you mean it didn't start? Is there a job in bitsadmin?

2020-08-25T14:28:23 mushroom -> bentley
If there is, it will run anyway, last time started in 2 hours.

2020-08-25T14:29:16 bentley -> mushroom
Yes there is. I remembered.

2020-08-25T14:30:19 mushroom -> bentley
These are the very blank ones.

2020-08-25T14:30:28 bentley -> mushroom
aah

2020-08-25T14:30:32 mushroom -> bentley
Because they're not bots.

2020-08-25T14:30:46 mushroom -> bentley
They don't know what to answer.

As an example.

2020-08-25T14:33:52 mushroom -> bentley
Blank. Without like I told you my bot sends 3 requests first. So accordingly no command will work since it's not a bot.

2020-08-25T14:34:45 mushroom -> bentley
8d63d3d0efb5c414b02b06f68e4799ac

2020-08-25T14:34:53 mushroom -> bentley

2020-08-25T14:36:23 bentley -> mushroom

Tell him how to tell the difference between a normal bot.

2020-08-25T14:37:53 bentley -> mushroom
Here is his bot there are version requests. I've noticed that this is how hanypots behave as he describes

2020-08-25T14:38:45 mushroom -> bentley
It's not mine.

2020-08-25T14:38:59 mushroom -> bentley

This one is also I think explorers. And there's a group of two.

2020-08-25T14:57:58 bentley -> mushroom
yes

2020-08-25T14:58:03 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe they know some other bands.

2020-08-25T14:58:12 mushroom -> bentley
The method of groping.

2020-08-25T14:58:23 bentley -> mushroom
Yes, probably by trial and error.

2020-08-25T14:58:40 bentley -> mushroom
Not that they know, they're just trying to figure out what's what.

2020-08-25T14:59:15 mushroom -> bentley
Yes. Talar said that these pseudo bots send one request all the time /2

2020-08-25T14:59:22 mushroom -> bentley
And this is a team request.

2020-08-25T15:00:36 mushroom -> bentley
Tag them like a honeypot.

Can you also do a group of 8?

2020-09-02T08:31:32 mushroom -> bentley
I can. It'll be 4 now, then it'll be 8.

This is Group2.

2020-09-02T11:15:13 mushroom -> bentley
What kind of antivirus?

2020-09-02T11:15:32 bentley -> mushroom
Defender

2020-09-02T11:15:41 mushroom -> bentley
Is this MSVC?

2020-09-02T11:15:46 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-09-02T11:16:35 mushroom -> bentley
How about trying Clang?

2020-09-02T11:16:49 bentley -> mushroom
I'll try

2020-09-02T11:18:09 mushroom -> bentley
C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe is strange, I do not use svchost

2020-09-02T11:38:31 mushroom -> bentley
Now running dl2.exe MSVC x64 defender is silent on a clean virtual machine, bot appeared.

2020-09-02T11:39:20 bentley -> mushroom
That's weird. I'll check my source too.

2020-09-02T11:40:10 mushroom -> bentley
Remember you had that detect, then you look again and it's gone.

2020-09-02T11:40:21 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-09-02T11:40:55 mushroom -> bentley
By the way the x86 version is also clean if you need it, I cleaned it not long ago.

2020-09-02T11:41:09 mushroom -> bentley
But if anything Clang as a backup.

2020-09-02T11:41:21 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-09-02T12:04:40 bentley -> mushroom

Process Name: C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe What does this mean?

2020-09-02T12:06:11 mushroom -> bentley
A process that sticks?

2020-09-02T12:06:16 bentley -> mushroom
lf

2020-09-02T12:06:18 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-09-02T12:06:45 mushroom -> bentley
How can this be? If you run dl2.exe then the process dl2.exe

2020-09-02T12:07:12 bentley -> mushroom
YES it was.

2020-09-02T12:12:29 bentley -> mushroom
Clang is also falling for 2019

no it's clean.

2020-09-02T12:14:20 mushroom -> bentley
Weird. I'll have to look into it.

2020-09-02T12:15:16 mushroom -> bentley
I'll step away for now.

2020-09-02T13:10:33 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T13:19:11 bentley -> mushroom
You have to download the client, run it and connect with these IDs and passwords.

2020-09-02T13:23:03 mushroom -> bentley
Connected.

2020-09-02T13:23:32 bentley -> mushroom
Okay

2020-09-02T13:31:18 mushroom -> bentley
How do you transfer a file?

2020-09-02T13:31:39 bentley -> mushroom
copypaste works

2020-09-02T13:31:48 bentley -> mushroom
Or via file exchange

2020-09-02T13:38:09 mushroom -> bentley
What's the address of that car there?

2020-09-02T13:38:26 mushroom -> bentley
MinGW seems to be able to run without detects.

2020-09-02T13:38:29 bentley -> mushroom
this is my vm on my home farm

2020-09-02T13:38:47 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T13:38:49 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T13:38:55 bentley -> mushroom
ah yes

2020-09-02T13:39:07 mushroom -> bentley
I'm still waiting for the system info to be done.

2020-09-02T13:43:11 mushroom -> bentley
Executed.

2020-09-02T13:43:18 mushroom -> bentley
Checking the fixation.

2020-09-02T13:44:38 mushroom -> bentley
Question. I clicked just run teamviewer, does that mean it's not installed on the system?

2020-09-02T13:44:56 bentley -> mushroom
Yes it is not installed

2020-09-02T13:47:51 mushroom -> bentley
It all worked out.

2020-09-02T13:48:03 mushroom -> bentley
MinGW build_x64_release_no_logs

2020-09-02T13:48:18 mushroom -> bentley
This is for the bootloader.

2020-09-02T13:48:28 mushroom -> bentley
Bot leave it as it is.

2020-09-02T13:48:31 bentley -> mushroom
And without logs?

2020-09-02T13:48:41 mushroom -> bentley
build_x64_release_no_logs

2020-09-02T13:48:45 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T13:48:50 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-09-02T13:48:53 bentley -> mushroom
I'll chase it away.

2020-09-02T13:48:57 mushroom -> bentley
that's what it is without logs.

2020-09-02T13:49:22 mushroom -> bentley
There's a file on the desktop loader. It's called bad.exe

2020-09-02T13:49:31 mushroom -> bentley
Coming out.

2020-09-02T13:49:58 mushroom -> bentley
It works now 54c09681de00a941422535459432da5c

2020-09-02T13:50:32 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T13:50:41 bentley -> mushroom

2020-09-02T13:51:14 mushroom -> bentley
I'll have other builds install Server 2019 and see more.

2020-09-02T13:51:44 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-09-02T13:57:15 mushroom -> bentley
If you can't find bad.exe, its a command suicide cleaned up. Get it from MinGW build_x64_release_no_logs

2020-09-02T13:57:27 bentley -> mushroom

2020-09-02T13:57:43 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T15:40:39 mushroom -> bentley
which is in temp

2020-09-02T15:40:52 bentley -> mushroom
why?

2020-09-02T15:41:03 mushroom -> bentley
What kind of program is this?

2020-09-02T15:41:08 bentley -> mushroom
backdoor is the same

2020-09-02T15:41:31 bentley -> mushroom
This is after the launch of the loeder bk

2020-09-02T15:41:44 mushroom -> bentley
And the backdoor doesn't download to the drive in temp

2020-09-02T15:42:15 bentley -> mushroom
Hmmm... exactly the same

2020-09-02T15:43:05 mushroom -> bentley
It could be that he's downloading an update of himself, and there are 32 and 64 versions mixed up.

2020-09-02T15:43:58 mushroom -> bentley
Or it doesn't give out a program file, it's been done before.

2020-09-02T15:44:10 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T15:45:06 bentley -> mushroom

2020-09-02T15:45:52 mushroom -> bentley
MinGW only for the loader, the bot does not need to use MinGW.

2020-09-02T15:46:43 bentley -> mushroom
bot use MSVC

2020-09-02T15:46:53 mushroom -> bentley
And if you set the same version as he has in the admin, he will not download the update for himself.

2020-09-02T15:51:13 mushroom -> bentley
Looked the right one downloaded.

2020-09-02T15:51:30 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T15:51:37 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-02T15:52:21 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-09-02T15:52:36 mushroom -> bentley
Version 158

2020-09-02T15:56:55 mushroom -> bentley
MinGW checked also the same download 571392 bytes.

2020-09-03T08:01:38 mushroom -> bentley
Hi. So how is the MinGW loader good?

2020-09-03T08:03:00 bentley -> mushroom
Hi. Haven't finished testing yet, I'll get to it now.

2020-09-03T08:04:56 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-03T11:32:58 mushroom -> bentley
I didn't get any detects.

2020-09-03T11:33:42 mushroom -> bentley

I have a detection. I can give you the car through the timecar where the detector was

2020-09-03T11:50:20 mushroom -> bentley
Can you check on another Server 2019?

2020-09-03T11:50:48 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe on that defender file remembered.

2020-09-03T11:51:01 bentley -> mushroom
No, I'm rolling it all back.

Try running it on another Server 2019, don't you have one?

2020-09-03-03T11:51:56 mushroom -> bentley
MSVC version only.

2020-09-03T11:52:15 bentley -> mushroom

What build? Today's?

2020-09-03T11:53:08 mushroom -> bentley
The one I did yesterday for group 2. I'm running it on mine. It sticks, you said.

2020-09-03T11:53:17 bentley -> mushroom
Yeah ok

2020-09-03T11:58:05 mushroom -> bentley
I have only sending samples disabled in defender.

2020-09-03T11:58:23 bentley -> mushroom
Same topic.

2020-09-03-03T11:58:32 bentley -> mushroom
How did you upload the file? Through a link?

2020-09-03T11:58:55 mushroom -> bentley
I copied it through the shared folder.

2020-09-03T11:59:26 bentley -> mushroom
Try the link from qaz.im Maybe that's it

2020-09-03T11:59:40 mushroom -> bentley
I'll give it a try.

2020-09-03T12:07:59 mushroom -> bentley
It's weird, but it also works if you download through a browser.

2020-09-03T12:08:08 mushroom -> bentley
I'll check the reboot now.

2020-09-03T12:08:35 mushroom -> bentley
What user do you run it under?

2020-09-03T12:08:50 bentley -> mushroom
Administartor

2020-09-03T12:08:55 mushroom -> bentley
Also.

2020-09-03T12:09:57 mushroom -> bentley
Do the other groups roll my, only 2 on Server 2019 sticks?

2020-09-03T12:10:10 mushroom -> bentley
Do 8 and 4 work?

2020-09-03T12:10:21 bentley -> mushroom
Van's, Swift's, and yours are straying. Frog doesn't.

2020-09-03T12:11:04 mushroom -> bentley
And everyone has the same detection?

2020-09-03T12:11:24 bentley -> mushroom
Almost. Vatakat or invazhn.

2020-09-03T12:12:43 mushroom -> bentley
Strange that there is no Wakatak on 10.

2020-09-03T12:13:12 mushroom -> bentley
dl1 had a wakatak often&

2020-09-03T12:15:41 bentley -> mushroom
Yes, it was.

2020-09-03T13:16:18 mushroom -> bentley
What size should the bootloader preferably be?

2020-09-03-03T13:16:50 bentley -> mushroom
100-200 kB

2020-09-03T13:17:20 mushroom -> bentley
356 with a cobbled together obfuscation

2020-09-03T13:17:37 bentley -> mushroom

Hi. I didn't figure out yesterday how to determine where my program is straying. I need to run the Server 2019 version with logs and I can use the logs to determine where my work is interrupted. Give me access or run the logged version of MSVC.

2020-09-04T07:45:05 bentley -> mushroom
I'll do it. With logs.

2020-09-04T09:50:29 bentley -> mushroom
The logged file is not detected

2020-09-04T09:51:25 bentley -> mushroom
And the same build without logs immediately detects Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml on startup

2020-09-04T09:51:59 mushroom -> bentley
This is a static Wacatac& detection

2020-09-04T09:52:23 mushroom -> bentley
It's the one I removed. I'm interested in Invasion after launch.

2020-09-04T09:53:00 mushroom -> bentley
And x86 without logs run MSVC.

2020-09-04T09:53:20 bentley -> mushroom
Will it work on 64?

2020-09-04T09:53:44 mushroom -> bentley
Of course, 2 bit programs run on 64 bit systems.

2020-09-07T11:36:06 bentley -> mushroom

2020-09-07T11:36:43 bentley -> mushroom
I'll check it again today, then.

2020-09-07T11:41:44 mushroom -> bentley

2020-09-08T15:43:19 mushroom -> bentley
You said it doesn't stain on Server 2019, but x64 does.

2020-09-08T15:43:35 bentley -> mushroom
Yes, it was.

2020-09-08T15:43:46 mushroom -> bentley
I thought it was being used.

2020-09-08T15:44:07 mushroom -> bentley
Only there bot version 107 is loaded for x86 loader.

2020-09-08T15:45:47 mushroom -> bentley
So you don't use x86? Waiting for x64?

2020-09-08T15:46:10 bentley -> mushroom
Not given out in battle yet

2020-09-08T15:47:30 mushroom -> bentley
Clarification for x86, you have to use 32 bit programs for holoving too. There are no other differences.

2020-09-11T07:23:05 bentley -> mushroom

2020-09-16T11:55:52 mushroom -> bentley
3 doesn't count, it's a firewall.

2020-09-16T11:56:13 mushroom -> bentley
And the one that's left by the crypt is cleaned up.

2020-09-16T11:56:30 mushroom -> bentley
That's what I sent you today checked.

2020-09-16T11:56:33 bentley -> mushroom

2020-09-16T12:09:50 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-09-16T12:09:54 bentley -> mushroom
 Is it about the crypt?

2020-09-16T12:09:59 mushroom -> bentley
And took out the one I was talking about.

2020-09-16T12:10:32 mushroom -> bentley
Without crypt: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/cd03f71be2e260518318368aeb6b7ffd
With crypt: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/54e145a7b7b89145be2c9e1a4e4e7bb7

2020-09-16T12:10:52 bentley -> mushroom
Yeset has been removed.

2020-09-16T12:11:07 mushroom -> bentley
Yes and left that firewall.

2020-09-16T12:11:17 mushroom -> bentley
And 3 detects he added to them.

2020-09-16T12:12:25 mushroom -> bentley
He added Norton, F-Secure and 360 Security.

2020-09-16T12:14:45 mushroom -> bentley
Norton is also a firewall.

Lf cvjnhtk xtnrj dct

2020-09-24T07:52:21 bentley -> mushroom
Yes, I've seen it all clearly.

2020-09-24T07:52:45 mushroom -> bentley
All three?

2020-09-24T07:53:00 bentley -> mushroom
Can you build a few loaders today with different nigden pads used before. So that 1 loader 1 new ipi.

2020-09-24T07:53:01 mushroom -> bentley
Even the one that weighs 14kb?

2020-09-24T07:53:12 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-09-24T07:54:27 mushroom -> bentley
That is, you need 1 loeder 1 address, before that was a list of addresses, and the list goes to the first from which it was able to download?

2020-09-24T07:55:08 bentley -> mushroom
Yes right 1 loeder 1 address clean unique nowhere used

2020-09-24T07:57:15 mushroom -> bentley
I'll put the unused ones at the top of the list, then they'll be connected to first, and the old ones will be in the back in case the gasket dies.

2020-09-24T07:58:02 bentley -> mushroom
With different first pads yes?

2020-09-24T07:58:54 mushroom -> bentley
Yes.

2020-09-24T07:59:06 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-09-24T08:04:31 mushroom -> bentley
I just looked at my 6 addresses and they are all new.

2020-09-24T08:04:49 bentley -> mushroom
Does Van have others?

2020-09-24T08:04:57 bentley -> mushroom
He did that with unic addresses too

2020-09-24T08:05:16 mushroom -> bentley
I don't think so. They just sent them to me today. He probably got them too.

2020-09-24T08:05:51 bentley -> mushroom
Need to clarify. How do you do that?

2020-09-24T08:06:38 mushroom -> bentley
I understand multiple loaders to connect to different addresses.

2020-09-24T08:06:46 mushroom -> bentley
I'll make 3 of them.

2020-09-24T08:06:52 bentley -> mushroom

When testing, there was a detection at the start of the executable

2020-09-28T11:29:54 bentley -> mushroom
<hlor>
Only on vin10 (defender version in vin19 is identical) when running the exe file for the second time with the process-host scvhost detected and did not start the exe file (with the status of operation done in the admin panel). I.e. the first time with the explorer host everything worked everywhere, the second time with scvhost detected only in win10 and the machine is alive, reacts to commands (I ran heatsinfo after this situation), nothing was deleted, the only thing that happened - in the described situation the exe file did not work

> yes, with scvhost, between status pending and done
[18:28:43] <hlor> only ran twice, the only consequence the first time calc.exe didn't run, nothing else
[18:28:51] <hlor> worked the second time, with the same host

2020-09-28T11:34:31 mushroom -> bentley
Do you mean the command when you run the Run exe command?

2020-09-28T11:34:45 bentley -> mushroom
yes

2020-09-28T11:34:57 mushroom -> bentley
And this is Win32/DefenseEvasion.KQ!ml

C:\Users\john\Desktop\dl2.exe

2020-09-28T11:35:17 bentley -> mushroom
Yes

2020-09-28T11:35:28 mushroom -> bentley
When the Run exe command the loader is no longer running.

2020-09-28T11:36:08 mushroom -> bentley
How did you run the Run exe command?

2020-09-28T11:36:21 mushroom -> bentley
Did you download the dl2.exe file there?

2020-09-28T11:36:47 bentley -> mushroom
No calc.exe

2020-09-28T11:37:55 mushroom -> bentley
And that once detected and didn't remove anything, and the second time it worked?

2020-09-28T11:38:37 bentley -> mushroom
Sec is going to text you now. This is our new tester.

2020-09-28T11:42:31 bentley -> mushroom
You're about to get a knock.

2020-09-28T12:15:08 mushroom -> bentley
Is there a crypto dl2?

2020-09-28T12:16:32 mushroom -> bentley
And another question, have you used what I sent last week? If used, then crypto?

2020-09-28T12:16:42 bentley -> mushroom
I'm going to clarify.

2020-09-28T12:28:20 bentley -> mushroom
<deploy@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> Haven't done dl2 yet
[19:27:25] <deploy@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> Not used last week

2020-09-30T08:11:30 mushroom -> bentley
Hi, is my kit working?

2020-09-30T08:12:15 bentley -> mushroom
Hi. I'll clarify a little later when Deploy arrives. Please collect 2 different lowers with unic ipi today

2020-09-30T08:52:59 mushroom -> bentley
Has Frog been used, does the kit work?

2020-09-30T08:54:03 bentley -> mushroom
He has a detect after a reboot.

2020-09-30T08:54:20 bentley -> mushroom
 <frog> Hi. It works fine on first run, but detected on second run.
Detect: Behavior:Win32/DefenseEvasion

2020-09-30T08:54:40 bentley -> mushroom
1 more loider to do with all the ipi together.

2020-09-30T08:57:38 mushroom -> bentley
I told him to make a primitive without fixing, like Target ordered.

2020-09-30T08:58:59 bentley -> mushroom
Ok

2020-09-30T10:59:07 mushroom -> bentley
<ajrec> back to the old scheme. All the pads are in the loider. You don't need a lot of loaders.

2020-09-30T10:59:37 mushroom -> bentley
One loader to do then?

2020-09-30T10:59:46 mushroom -> bentley
It has 3 addresses.

2020-09-30T11:03:16 bentley -> mushroom
Unic addresses?

2020-09-30T11:03:50 mushroom -> bentley
https://62.108.35.194:443,https://45.141.103.194:443,https://91.235.129.110:443

2020-09-30T11:04:05 bentley -> mushroom
Okay

2020-09-30T11:04:19 mushroom -> bentley
Is that an unic?

2020-09-30T11:06:35 mushroom -> bentley
I can make 3 pieces, there addresses these three will be in different places, it will turn out that I will connect to different addresses first.

2020-09-30T11:07:51 mushroom -> bentley
Ask also then Target, if you need to make a window with an error, what to write there.

2020-09-30T11:08:04 mushroom -> bentley
I'll do it without the window for now.

2020-09-30T11:08:58 bentley -> mushroom
Wait while I clarify the gaskets

2020-09-30T11:09:04 bentley -> mushroom
<buza> well, it turns out it's about pads
[18:03:08] <buza> nothing else
[18:03:39] <bentley> Yeah.
[18:03:50] <buza> well wait for green
[18:03:57] <buza> let's not work without domains yet
[18:04:11] <buza> since what's the use of stealing cryptos if they don't knock anyway
[18:04:12] <bentley> already kinda gave out van and mashroom
[18:05:20] <buza> [14:04:32] <buza> green didn't give out domains? [14:04:59] <ajrec> no
[18:06:05] <bentley> And with unic ipi pads?
[18:06:18] <buza> it's bullshit
[18:06:22] <bentley> Or just waiting for sl domains?
[18:06:38] <buza> bounces on raw addresses with no signs of domain work immediately set up a firewall
[18:06:54] <bentley> I'll write to Target
[18:06:58] <buza> target clearly said - you need domains from amazon

2020-09-30T11:09:46 mushroom -> bentley
I have all the addresses working.

2020-09-30T11:09:59 mushroom -> bentley
If anything.

2020-09-30T11:10:26 mushroom -> bentley
On my test cars, maybe there's something else with the gaskets.

2020-09-30T11:10:36 mushroom -> bentley
Good waiting.

2020-10-01T14:08:53 bentley -> mushroom
ok

2020-10-01T14:10:04 mushroom -> bentley
There what loader is currently loaded in group 2?

2020-10-01T14:10:28 mushroom -> bentley
So it won't upgrade to the old one if the version doesn't match.

2020-10-01T14:11:16 mushroom -> bentley
158 is there, I'll make it 161. Only it will have to be uploaded there, or it will update to 158 scandalous.

2020-10-01T14:11:31 bentley -> mushroom
I'll put the signed one up when Deploy does.

2020-10-01T14:12:25 mushroom -> bentley

It is better not to use dl2.exe name in tests without crypt. It probably leaked to the cloud. Now running dl2.exe antivirus ate it up, changed it to dos.exe all is quiet.

2020-10-01T15:07:05 mushroom -> bentley
Well, in principle, I sent you all the loaders with the name dos.exe.

2020-10-02T09:36:35 mushroom -> bentley

[21:05:21] <bentley> yeah
[21:05:26] <buza> change them every day

2020-10-02T14:07:51 bentley -> mushroom
Will you make 1 test build?

2020-10-02T14:09:06 mushroom -> bentley
They don't change.

2020-10-02T14:09:39 mushroom -> bentley
The prefixes are /api/v9

2020-10-02T14:09:53 mushroom -> bentley
What do you mean?

2020-10-02T14:10:37 bentley -> mushroom

We're waiting for Talar, but I don't think we'll make it today until he gets back.

2020-10-02T14:17:30 mushroom -> bentley
All the old bots work, we'll be changing those prefixes in the new group.

2020-10-02T14:17:38 bentley -> mushroom

2020-10-02T14:17:43 bentley -> mushroom

2020-10-05T10:19:59 bentley -> mushroom
Is that the one I sent?

2020-10-05T10:20:04 bentley -> mushroom
encrypted?

2020-10-05T10:20:19 mushroom -> bentley
Yes. After the transcript.

2020-10-05T10:20:31 bentley -> mushroom
and the encrypted one is not?

2020-10-05T10:20:35 mushroom -> bentley
And saving to disk.

2020-10-05T10:21:18 mushroom -> bentley
You have to decrypt it before you can run it. Decrypted it, saved it to disk and then defender ate it.

2020-10-05T10:22:07 mushroom -> bentley
File is 756224 bytes.

2020-10-05T10:22:16 mushroom -> bentley
This one?

2020-10-05T10:22:51 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe it's just me, because I've got a bunch of dirty files teetering around.

2020-10-05T10:22:57 mushroom -> bentley
I'll send you the build now.

2020-10-05T10:23:03 bentley -> mushroom

No, I don't have one myself.

2020-10-05T10:44:52 mushroom -> bentley
Okay.

2020-10-05T10:45:03 bentley -> mushroom
can we fix it?

2020-10-05T10:45:44 mushroom -> bentley
You have to fix this program that downloads, it has a static detection.

2020-10-05T10:46:29 mushroom -> bentley
You try running it yourself not encrypted, defender will eat it up right away.

2020-10-05T10:46:44 mushroom -> bentley
Is she crypto herself?

2020-10-05T10:56:03 bentley -> mushroom
I ran the file just from the link and there is no detection.

2020-10-05T10:56:52 mushroom -> bentley

The crypt itself is intact.

2020-10-05T11:06:00 mushroom -> bentley
So the boot loader file is not stolen?

2020-10-05T11:06:16 bentley -> mushroom
crypto - no

2020-10-05T11:06:49 mushroom -> bentley
So I don't have to change anything?

2020-10-05T11:08:05 bentley -> mushroom
unclear

2020-10-05T11:08:13 bentley -> mushroom
What is stolen is the exe itself or the launch process.

2020-10-05T11:08:20 bentley -> mushroom
The eche itself is not encrypted - clear

2020-10-05T11:09:48 mushroom -> bentley
The exe itself sticks to me, when I debugged it sticks to me even before launching.

2020-10-05T11:10:06 mushroom -> bentley
Compare this exe from temp with the one that doesn't stray.

2020-10-05T11:10:08 bentley -> mushroom
Why doesn't just downloading it from the link panic the user?

2020-10-05T11:10:37 mushroom -> bentley
If they are identical, I will then download not in temp, maybe because of that.

2020-10-05T11:10:53 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-10-05T12:48:49 mushroom -> bentley
Do you have ipv6 addresses working in your browser?

2020-10-05T12:49:06 bentley -> mushroom
how to check?

2020-10-05T12:54:28 mushroom -> bentley
http://[fe80::216:3eff:fef2:45a2]

2020-10-05T12:54:45 mushroom -> bentley

2020-10-05T12:56:44 mushroom -> bentley
ipv6.google.com

2020-10-05T12:56:58 mushroom -> bentley
That's another one you should try.

2020-10-05T12:58:48 bentley -> mushroom
doesn't work

2020-10-05T13:00:11 mushroom -> bentley
https://test-ipv6.com/

2020-10-05T13:00:22 mushroom -> bentley
What does it show?

2020-10-05T13:00:58 bentley -> mushroom
No IPv6 address detected

2020-10-05T13:16:38 mushroom -> bentley
What about the file by the way, tried downloading in the download, as soon as the file is saved immediately detected by defender.

2020-10-05T13:16:57 bentley -> mushroom
It's not clear yet.

2020-10-05T13:17:14 mushroom -> bentley
Now I'll try some other file to download to be sure that it is the case.

2020-10-05T13:17:53 mushroom -> bentley
By the way there is no link to a file not bad and encrypted for the test?

2020-10-05T13:18:05 bentley -> mushroom
no

2020-10-05T13:35:53 mushroom -> bentley
If I upload another file, the defender won't say anything.

2020-10-05T13:36:49 bentley -> mushroom
ok so it's in the file

You sent instead of no logs an assembly with logs both in the logs folder and in the no logs folder

2020-10-06T15:33:38 bentley -> mushroom
in all builds

2020-10-06T15:33:51 mushroom -> bentley
Loider update, it downloads the one there loaded 163, and it's there with logs.

2020-10-06T15:33:59 bentley -> mushroom
а

2020-10-06T15:34:20 mushroom -> bentley
Because I gave version 164 and there's version 163 loaded.

got it, didn't count

2020-10-06T15:34:39 mushroom -> bentley

Misunderstood

2020-10-09T07:05:18 bentley -> mushroom
on crypto?

2020-10-09T07:06:17 mushroom -> bentley
It looks like a downloadable file of some sort. Is there no way to get it out?

2020-10-09T07:06:26 bentley -> mushroom
How?

2020-10-09T07:06:44 mushroom -> bentley
How does defender say to restore a file.

2020-10-09T07:07:08 mushroom -> bentley
In defender, choose to restore the file.

2020-10-09T07:07:16 bentley -> mushroom
I'll do

2020-10-09T07:17:15 mushroom -> bentley
You should probably choose to allow it first, then choose to restore on it. Then you can see what kind of file it is.

2020-10-09T07:17:31 bentley -> mushroom
yes

2020-10-09T07:42:03 mushroom -> bentley
What did you get out of it?

2020-10-09T07:42:59 bentley -> mushroom
doing

2020-10-09T08:12:20 mushroom -> bentley
Doing more builds?

2020-10-09T08:12:32 mushroom -> bentley
Removed 1 detection.

2020-10-09T08:12:46 mushroom -> bentley
For the source.

2020-10-09T08:12:49 bentley -> mushroom
Talk to Booza. I can't repeat the detec immediately takes down the krpt

2020-10-09T08:13:05 mushroom -> bentley
And you allow the crypt.

2020-10-09T08:13:13 mushroom -> bentley
You can roll it back later.

2020-10-09T08:13:26 mushroom -> bentley
Resolve and restore the crypt.

2020-10-09T08:13:34 bentley -> mushroom
allowed detection but now there is no detection on that file from tmp

2020-10-09T08:13:53 mushroom -> bentley
Do you have the file yourself?

2020-10-09T08:14:15 mushroom -> bentley
Find the *.exe file in the temp folder

2020-10-09T08:15:33 bentley -> mushroom
Now there is no exe there.

2020-10-09T08:16:25 mushroom -> bentley
Run crypt, if it eats it, resolve it and run it again.

2020-10-09T08:16:42 bentley -> mushroom
I did so

2020-10-09T08:17:02 mushroom -> bentley
And there is no exe there at all in temp?

2020-10-09T08:17:09 bentley -> mushroom
no

2020-10-09T08:18:38 mushroom -> bentley
Most likely it's a crypt file, because I name the files differently. I name them like this AF60.exe (without tmp in the name), and there AF60.tmp.exe.

2020-10-09T08:19:05 mushroom -> bentley
Ask whoever did the crypt, does he write anything in the temp folder.

2020-10-09T08:19:11 bentley -> mushroom
got it ok

2020-10-09T08:23:21 bentley -> mushroom
<deploy@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> I don't write anything in temp
[15:22:40] <deploy@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> I don't write any files to disks, everything works in memory

2020-10-09T08:23:39 mushroom -> bentley
That's what's weird.

2020-10-09T08:23:57 mushroom -> bentley
Does that detector not show up again?

2020-10-09T08:24:38 mushroom -> bentley
If you run it on a pumped out machine. When this file is not yet allowed in temp.

2020-10-09T08:24:51 bentley -> mushroom
There is no more such a detector.

2020-10-09T08:25:58 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe it was not connected with the loader and not with the bot, and lay there this file in temp for some time and started to fade, maybe it was from other tests what left?

2020-10-09T08:26:58 bentley -> mushroom
Let me show up again and I'll pull the file

2020-10-09T08:27:08 mushroom -> bentley
Yes.

2020-10-09T09:55:52 bentley -> mushroom
Will you make an assembly for the cb1 group ?

2020-10-09T12:44:20 mushroom -> bentley
What's the bootloader staring at?

2020-10-09T12:46:50 bentley -> mushroom
bentley> I checked the mushroom file and gave it to krypt
[19:23:28] <buza> mushroom uk sticks after crypt
[19:23:32] <bentley> aah
[19:23:38] <buza> don't understand
[19:23:47] <buza> can you check on vindef on different machines ancrypt?
[19:24:00] <bentley> yes I checked with me and 2 other testers
[19:24:05] <bentley> clear
[19:24:07] <buza> and everything was ok?
[19:24:09] <bentley> yes
[19:36:00] <deploy@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> If you move the file to the desktop, then ok, but if you upload to google drive download and then run it, it appears detected, after injecting into cmd
[19:36:57] <deploy@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> It's also how you check it

2020-10-09T14:01:32 mushroom -> bentley

Hi. Booza says they couldn't make the crypt for the o25 group. What was the detection there?

2020-10-15T08:03:56 bentley -> mushroom
Wakatak

2020-10-15T08:04:08 mushroom -> bentley
Static?

2020-10-15T08:04:22 bentley -> mushroom
No floating on the download

2020-10-15T08:04:25 bentley -> mushroom
I mean, it's not.

2020-10-15T08:10:23 mushroom -> bentley
On the download when you download the file with your browser?

2020-10-15T08:10:34 mushroom -> bentley
Or when the bootloader is running?

2020-10-15T08:10:54 bentley -> mushroom
Yes the crypt loeder itself from the direct link

2020-10-15T08:11:45 mushroom -> bentley
So it's a static detection.

2020-10-15T08:11:57 bentley -> mushroom
Checking on dincheck - everything's fine

2020-10-15T08:12:41 mushroom -> bentley
Maybe the link is compromised?

2020-10-15T08:12:54 bentley -> mushroom
Different ftp and google drive

2020-10-15T08:13:48 mushroom -> bentley
And the other files from there are downloaded without detects, right?

2020-10-15T08:14:14 bentley -> mushroom
It's just a crypt is not a loader without a detector

2020-10-28T10:43:38 bentley -> mushroom
Get sysinfo

2020-10-28T10:43:59 mushroom -> bentley
Is it always like this or is it random?

2020-10-28T10:44:12 mushroom -> bentley
There's nothing wrong with that command.

2020-10-28T10:44:21 bentley -> mushroom

2020-10-28T10:44:27 mushroom -> bentley

On the bootloader file.

2020-10-28T10:49:03 mushroom -> bentley
And it's not working at this point.

2020-10-28T10:49:10 mushroom -> bentley
When the bot works.

2020-10-28T10:49:49 mushroom -> bentley
You get a static detection.

2020-10-28T10:50:13 mushroom -> bentley
Prev-Complaint.exe is a boot loader, right?

2020-10-28T10:50:20 bentley -> mushroom
Yes, it's a crypt.

2020-10-28T10:50:38 mushroom -> bentley
Is it silent without the crypt?

2020-10-28T10:51:05 bentley -> mushroom
I'll take a look.

2020-10-28T10:51:14 bentley -> mushroom
Without crypt, it was detected immediately upon unpacking

2020-10-28T10:51:44 mushroom -> bentley
Which ones?

2020-10-28T10:51:55 mushroom -> bentley

Yep

2020-10-29T15:21:48 bentley -> mushroom
Perfixes from yesterday, right?

2020-10-29T15:22:34 mushroom -> bentley
No.

2020-10-29T15:22:58 mushroom -> bentley
That's what I wrote when I was checking out today's build.

2020-10-29T15:23:13 bentley -> mushroom
In the file that is in the kit and in the admin panel are identical

2020-10-29T15:23:22 mushroom -> bentley
Yes.

2020-10-29T15:23:31 bentley -> mushroom
3 3 and 36 ok

2020-10-29T15:23:32 mushroom -> bentley
So I already changed them for you.

2020-10-29T15:23:59 bentley -> mushroom
To upload new files, delete old ones with the same pervix yes?

2020-10-29T15:24:04 mushroom -> bentley
Then just make it clear that convergence is everywhere.

2020-10-29T15:24:31 mushroom -> bentley
Yes, delete old ones and upload new ones, change versions to new ones.

2020-10-29T15:25:37 mushroom -> bentley
Delete everything in there.

2020-10-29T15:25:45 bentley -> mushroom
Delete everything in there.

2020-10-29T15:25:49 mushroom -> bentley
Not to be confused.

2020-10-29T15:26:03 mushroom -> bentley
Then upload a new one there with the new versions.

2020-10-29T15:26:16 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-10-29T15:26:46 mushroom -> bentley
By the way, when you delete everything, the prefixes are gone.

2020-10-29T15:27:02 bentley -> mushroom
Yes Van said.

2020-10-29T15:27:03 mushroom -> bentley
And the versions will disappear.

2020-10-29T15:27:28 mushroom -> bentley
You've seen the prefixes in the file:
/32/issuance
/33/issuance
/35/issuance
/36/issuance

2020-10-29T15:27:33 bentley -> mushroom

2020-10-29T15:32:05 bentley -> mushroom
The new loider you gave out will bump with the BC, which is filled in the admin panel?

2020-10-29T15:32:38 mushroom -> bentley
Yes.

2020-10-29T15:33:04 bentley -> mushroom
Okay

2020-10-29T15:33:36 mushroom -> bentley
The main thing is the prefixes.

2020-10-29T15:33:56 mushroom -> bentley
It will download and run anything by those prefixes downloaded.

2020-10-29T15:34:07 bentley -> mushroom
Got it

2020-10-29T15:36:07 mushroom -> bentley
Clarification. The gasket addresses in the new version have changed.

Older ones may not work, haven't checked.

2020-10-29T15:36:35 mushroom -> bentley
New ones checked out.

2020-10-29T15:37:13 mushroom -> bentley
Keep that in mind when you use an older version.

2020-10-29T15:39:42 bentley -> mushroom
So now I run a new version of the reader and did not fill in the admin with a new version of the uk and there is a chance that it will not work?

2020-10-29T15:40:43 mushroom -> bentley
Check.

2020-10-29T15:40:58 mushroom -> bentley
If the addresses don't work the old ones do.

2020-10-29T15:41:09 bentley -> mushroom
Yes I see that it has not knocked for 10 minutes

2020-10-29T15:41:14 bentley -> mushroom
I'll upload it then.

2020-10-29T15:49:43 mushroom -> bentley
If you use Staged execution files, notice the old prefixes there.

2020-10-29T15:49:57 bentley -> mushroom
Yes, I'll put the new ones in.

2020-10-29T15:50:23 bentley -> mushroom
Does the old file have to be deleted from there or does it go over with the new prefixes?

2020-10-29T15:51:31 mushroom -> bentley
The one you choose there set to production will be used for example.

2020-10-29T15:52:12 mushroom -> bentley
The main prefixes are the download paths.

2020-10-29T15:52:51 mushroom -> bentley
In short, to avoid starting delete all files at all, load a new one with prefixes and version.

Maybe the addresses don't work there, this has happened before, addresses work in one place and not in another.

2020-10-29T16:35:03 bentley -> mushroom
Is HTTP ERROR 404 supposed to be like this?

2020-10-29T16:35:58 mushroom -> bentley
Along with the prefix, try the loader addresses.

2020-10-29T16:36:09 mushroom -> bentley
The file should download.

2020-10-29T16:36:23 mushroom -> bentley

Yep

2020-10-29T16:37:15 bentley -> mushroom
Why isn't it knocking?

2020-10-29T16:37:28 mushroom -> bentley
Run it with the logs.

Complaining about the hand keyboard

2020-10-29T16:47:09 mushroom -> bentley
It's that comp again. Had the same problem on Monday, never removed the Russian layout.

2020-10-29T16:47:24 mushroom -> bentley
That's the way it's supposed to be.

2020-10-29T16:47:46 mushroom -> bentley
If the layout or system language is CIS it won't work.

2020-10-29T16:47:51 mushroom -> bentley
That's the way it's meant to be.

2020-10-29T16:47:52 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-10-29T16:48:40 mushroom -> bentley
And on that computer it wasn't disabled to send samples I remember.

2020-10-29T16:48:54 bentley -> mushroom
It's on a different computer.

2020-10-29T16:48:55 mushroom -> bentley
Checking it out?

2020-10-29T16:49:03 mushroom -> bentley
OK.

2020-10-29T16:49:05 bentley -> mushroom

When you upload the same file there, with the same version, the old one should be deleted.

2020-10-30T10:31:03 bentley -> mushroom
Yep

2020-10-30T10:31:20 mushroom -> bentley
There turns out to be a glitch in such cases where two files with the same version are loaded.

2020-10-30T13:26:34 mushroom -> bentley
What is the maximum size the bootloader should be?

If you don't see the icon, rename it to exe and you will.

2020-10-30T13:57:38 mushroom -> bentley
Got it?

2020-10-30T13:57:52 bentley -> mushroom

2020-10-30T13:58:04 mushroom -> bentley
Check it out so I know.

2020-10-30T13:58:14 mushroom -> bentley
Should I do the same from here on out or not.

2020-10-30T14:01:29 mushroom -> bentley
Actually there is an icon, this is how Explorer displays it if the resolution is not exe.

2020-10-30T14:01:39 mushroom -> bentley
PDF icon

2020-10-30T14:01:48 bentley -> mushroom
There the gaskets lay

2020-10-30T14:03:37 mushroom -> bentley
Yeah none at the bootloader works.

2020-10-30T15:27:16 mushroom -> bentley
Should I make some more in case the pads come back to life or don't come back to life?

2020-10-30T15:28:05 bentley -> mushroom
Should come to life.
