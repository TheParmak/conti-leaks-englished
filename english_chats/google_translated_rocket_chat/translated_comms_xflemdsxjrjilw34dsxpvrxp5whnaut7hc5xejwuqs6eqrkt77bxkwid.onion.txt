Commenting on the topic of interference in elections, he noted that “digital giants are fed up with everyone, including the United States,” and said that *Russia should have tools to influence foreign digital platforms.* Medvedev also answered a question about political competition in Russia and told what he thinks about blocking Trump by the leadership of Western social networks.

This is a kms server and its sources. Inside the installation script, it just contains commands manually to the console (only 3 commands, xs why the script does not work out). Install kms server on any machine in the network.
Further from other machines we register its ip, usually like this
```
slmgr /ipk FJ82H-XT6CR-J8D7P-XQJJ2-GPDD4
slmgr /skms <IP>:1688
slmgr /ato
```
Key - kms key for the system, kms keys on the ms website in the public domain.
Volume edition is usually activated, Evaluation is not activated.
This kms can activate both windows and office.
The office is usually activated like this:
```
cd c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15
cscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:<cms-office key here>
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:192.168.1.10

1) change the password and log out from all places.
2) log in with a new password.
3) go back to the settings and select Reset E2E Key
4) log out from all places again
5) log in and a new key from e2e will be shown, write it down
6) log out again

Message: `REvil faction went offline forever

Reuters writes that the REvil group was hacked and disabled as a result of the operation of several countries. After the story with Kaseya and the mysterious disappearance of the representative of Unknown, someone appeared under the nickname "0_neday," who announced the resumption of the work of the group and the raising of sites (probably meaning Happy Blog) from backups, but he was not aware that the backups had already been compromised by special services.

“The REvil ransomware gang restored the infrastructure from backups, assuming that they were not compromised,” comments Oleg Skulkin, Deputy Head of the Group-IB Computer Forensics Lab. "Ironically, the gang's favorite tactic - compromising backups - was turned against them."

Also, an unnamed anonymous Reuters source claims that a certain foreign partner of the US government carried out a hacking operation against REvil, as a result of which he managed to get into REvil's computer architecture.

The FBI, in conjunction with Cyber Command, the Secret Service and like-minded countries, have truly engaged in significant disruptive actions against these groups,” said Kellermann, an adviser to the US Secret Service on cybercrime investigations. “REvil was top of the list.”

"Before, you couldn't hack into these forums, and the military didn't want to have anything to do with it. Since then, the gloves have come off."

It turns out that the search for REvil all this time was carried out not only by the FBI and the Secret Service, but also by military analysts from the US Cyber Command. According to US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, attacks on critical US infrastructure should be regarded as a US national threat. Accordingly, such actions of the groups led to the fact that the military from the US Department of Defense and intelligence intervened in the process to actively counter the lockers.`

So they didn’t pay for the bodies all these years, and I ran into as much as 6,000 rubles of debt. In short, the bailiff then did not get to my current accounts, but got to the local ones. There, in theory, I withdrew all the money when I left. But by some miracle, 1000 r remained, and they wrote off this thousand :)
But right now, this probably won’t work, because. bigdata on all users began to collect.

Chet didn't notice. I receive both Tinkov and VTB cards, I didn’t notice the difference. Here is a Sperbank card I use only to pay for a communal / telephone / Internet. I don’t keep more than 10 sput on it.

According to Pavlovich, the night before, when he checked into the hotel, he somehow "rang" in the database. The police came for him, but before taking him to the department, the employees allowed him to finish the meal: "everything is aesthetic."

In the department, he spent some time in a cell with people who were not very pleasant to him, they took off his belt, watch and laces. According to the hacker, after several questions from the prosecutor, he was released. “Alive, healthy, free, enjoying the slightly cool St. Petersburg air,” he wrote.

Pavlovich also noted that he was wanted in 2007, and now he is solving this issue with the Americans through a lawyer.

Message: The essence of "inclusive capitalism" is the abolition of private property and a distributive economy. That is, there will be no private property and share capital, no share in any enterprise. Instead of shareholders, there will be stakeholders - minor beneficiaries who do not have a share. Personal homes and vehicles are going to be cancelled. That is, there will be rented housing and carsharing. The middle layer is destroyed, it is forbidden to breed animals. (Have you heard that a law has now passed that animals cannot be raised in dachas? - now drones fly and track down who has a chicken coop, who will be noticed - a fine). Social distancing is being introduced, everyone should stay at home and not gather more than 3 people. All in order to take away from people the basics of self-sufficiency (personal farmstead and garden), so that they depend on the system, plus divide society as much as possible (so that they do not protest). QR codes are another tool to cut off the dissatisfied from social networks. infrastructure.

Message: Hello everyone
Has anyone come up with a temporary simple solution to the torus blocking problem?
Like take the cheapest dedik and put Tor Browser there, and so go to the tor? Or something like that.
Now the blocking is not massive, but after the new year I feel it will become a problem.

Many exchanges either simply refund funds or charge an additional 5% for withdrawals due to the origin of the funds.

Our team is as strong as Jennifer Lopez's ass, and the strength to fuck our enemies is comparable to Woodman's erection!
We are strong, invincible and awesome!

Well, in the end, they told me later, that’s how he goes to school now - it’s warm, you fuck off. I had to say that I was sick)))

1. Install any VPN browser extension.
2. Get bridges "https://bridges.torproject.org/"
3. Go to the browser settings and in the item "Find in settings" write "Bridges".
4. We specify our bridges and TorBrowser comes to life.

Instructions on how to restore the work of <TorExpertBundle>:

1. Copy the "PluggableTransports" directory and the "torrc" file.
```
cmd cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\
cmd copy Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Tor\PluggableTransports TorExpertBundle\Tor\PluggableTransports
cmd copy Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor\torrc TorExpertBundle\Tor\torrc
```
2. We change the contents of the "torrc" file, substituting our directories and new bridges.
```

Message: Andrey Skomorokh, General Director of the Russian company Gazprom-Kazakhstan, admitted a mistake in the unjustified increase in gas prices in Kazakhstan. The head of the enterprise laid the blame on the economist, who used depreciation rates for Russia when setting the gas price in the republic .

“A specialist from our main office in St. Petersburg mixed up the multiplying factor and incorrectly calculated the price. In Russia, we raise gas prices by up to 50% every year. In our country, rising prices usually do not lead to such serious consequences. People just pay and drive silently. It is unfortunate that such an unfortunate situation has arisen because of such a misunderstanding. We hope that the market will stabilize soon and people will get used to the new reality. Once again, we apologize to all residents of Kazakhstan and wish you a Merry Christmas,” said the CEO of the company.

Skomorokh added that it is not possible to lower the gas price in Kazakhstan due to the approved budget for 2022. According to him, the profitable part of the company is not subject to change under any circumstances and it will be possible to review it only in December of the current year.

Message: Brief outlines of the situation in Kazakhstan:

1. In Kazakhstan, they are silent about this, but in fact, the most important personnel decision was the dismissal of Nazarbayev's nephew from the post of first deputy head of the National Security Committee. Abish Samat oversaw shadow jamaats, criminal groups and other marginal foam, which is now taking part in a coup d'état. It is not clear if Samat's ears stick out behind the current unrest, but that he has something to do with it is undeniable;

2. Unexpectedly for many, the outwardly monolithic system of Kazakhstan has cracked, this is evidenced by the resignation of the Cabinet of Ministers and the vague actions of the security forces;

3. Apparently, the Soros network and the State Department have nothing to do with what is happening, the current rebellion is quite in the spirit of domestic political traditions. But this does not mean that Western partners will not intercept the protest. This is eloquently evidenced by the puffing of the cheeks by Oblyazov and the attempt of the grant-eating media to cover the protests by silently looting and violence;

4. Ethnic cleansing is not deliberately promoted, but the problem is clearly visible on the horizon. And if now calls to drive the Russians sound sluggish and in the background, then in the event of an aggravation of the situation, the pogrom of Russians (like the Uyghurs, for example) can become such a descent of steam, entertainment - in any incomprehensible situation, smash strangers;

5. Will Russia take northern Kazakhstan under its wing? NO, under no circumstances. This is a terrible dream of the leadership of the Russian Federation. Well, except perhaps in the scenario of a total war of all against all with a complete loss of statehood.

P2P and online exchangers! How do banks know that a transfer is a crypto?

If you exchange your crypto via P2P, for example, on the Binance exchange or through any online exchanger, then you receive funds from individuals and, as a rule, there are no notes that this is money for cryptocurrency.

Therefore , it all depends on the specific bank on the card of which you accept such payments. Some banks track such receipts more meticulously, and some less.

Much here depends on the regularity of transfers and their volumes. If you accept small payments on your card from time to time, then most likely neither the bank nor the tax office will have any questions for you.

Message: ```
How does the tax office know that the transfer was for a crypt? Money just came to the card from the card of another person! Maybe they returned the debt to me, but it wasn’t necessarily the sale of the crypt?

As a rule, banks report to the tax authorities and Rosfinmonitoring on major transactions. If these transactions are systematic, then they attract attention. When additional attention is called for, we are blocked under Article 115-FZ, that is, it is a matter of the volume and systematic nature of these transactions.

Accordingly , the data that you will transfer to the bank as an economic justification for the activity, within the framework of 115-FZ, may be with the tax authorities.

According to the law, it is necessary to pay personal income tax of 13% from the sale of the crypt, this is in theory. How about in practice?
Really tax sees all these transactions? In general, what can you say about this topic?

There are the main types of crypts, rubles / dollars / euros, a built-in exchanger for all this. The withdrawal limit is $999 (and from a year ago it was $2000). This is without verification. Compared to kiwi and Yandex money, a normal limit (not 15,000 r)

Yes , there is just a problem with Linux servers related to the implementation of dlopen
There is a command for spawning monsters and it looks for a symbol in the server module with the name of the entity of the desired monster and calls it as a function.
And dlopen looks for symbols in all loaded modules, including libc.
You can call printf on a server and shit in the console.

If I write to someone and within 3 hours I do not receive an answer during working hours, I put a note to myself. 2 notes and we say goodbye. There is no place for razeboys here, you don’t want to work and move with the team in the same direction - ALL THE GOOD. If someone doesn’t like something and he doesn’t agree with something, write in a personal. Have a good work week everyone!

Message: Vladimir Putin spoke for the first time on the initiative of the Central Bank to ban cryptocurrency in Russia. In short: no need to ban. If long:

- 6 million Russians keep their savings in cryptocurrency. The total amount is several trillion rubles. This money must remain with their owners;

— Blockchain and crypto is a magnet for thousands of innovative projects involving young and active people. Predictably, they live and work in countries with the most attractive cryptoclimate. We need to become such a country.

— Russia is in third place in the world in digital currency mining. There is no need to lose this position, a digital financial structure is good;

In general: no need to ban. It is necessary to create an understandable legal system for everything related to cryptocurrencies. Transparent rules, understandable mechanisms, security and adequate taxation.

Message: @angelo , I dedicate these lines that are not hidden anywhere to you
Advance , advance, where are you running,
Advance , advance, where are you in a hurry,
We missed each other somewhere,
Advance , advance, where are you, wait.
I don't want, I don't want again
to catch up with pigeons,
Feathered rats, though not to your taste
couple of carcasses

The old ladies look at us askance,
They don’t recognize yesterday’s respectable young people who are promising, to what life has brought,
And we (insert name) are walking around the yard,
Let 's look at the heating main, suddenly we find someone

When you request wallets for your seed phrase, a private key is generated based on the seed. Next, addresses are sequentially generated and requested in the blockchain. As soon as an address is not found in the blockchain, further generation immediately stops .

Message: [ ](https://xflemdsxjrjilw34dsxpvrxp5whnaut7hc5xejwuqs6eqrkt77bxkwid.onion/channel/general?msg=QjxfAoHGoKC4Li5YX) I will take nginx and it will proxy the path to some face of an online game. The same tanks or lines. or whatever is now pop ular .

Then take register a domain similar to that of that game. Here and yuzay inside as you like. And for fake connections - let nginx proxy some thread uri to nodejs script - websocket server. And then from other places you connect via wss and drive random data there at random times. The main thing to remember is that the client always sends 10-100 times less than he receives.

Message: In short, everything is banal. The problem is with va_list, or rather in the functions that use it. In this case, vfprintf and if you use vprintf and vsprintf, there will be no difference either.
The whole point is that MSVC - in the v * printf function does not change va_list. Also, other (but not all) compilers don't change either. But gcc does not save values when used.
Therefore, after the first vfprintf, the data in va_list no longer has the correct pointer . And reuse causes a crash.

There are 2 types of them, one is ordinary (sticking), and the second is culinary (do not stick). But there was not much control anywhere . Therefore, we were guided by prices - it was necessary to take the cheapest and most dubious packages (or even by weight) - that's where most often there was what was needed. Again, you need the most common whole nuts. And you need to chew them well (ideally, washing down with kefir ). I got 3 nuts.

I just remembered the news that the DPR sold it everywhere and there were buyers. There coal is awesome for the steel industry. For this reason, ore was previously transported to the Donetsk region for smelting.

1) a buffer between the Russian Federation and a potential NATO member
2) there is a lot of good coal, and most importantly, it is close to the Russian Federation, and not in the ass of a world like Siberia
3) there, in fact, the entire population is Russian-speaking. In the DPR, Russian is spoken better and more often than in the villages of the Rostov region.
4) Access to the sea - her, Azov is a swamp, muddy and shallow. Infrastructure seaside 10 years ago was in complete asshole.

PS every summer I visited the Donetsk region and perfectly saw that fucked up thing that was going on there. Wherever you go, there was devastation everywhere. After the USSR, perhaps only when Akhmetov took everything into his own hands (bought) it began to flourish.

Friends !

sincerely apologize for the fact that the last few days I was forced to ignore your questions. Regarding the Chief, Silver, sn and everything else.
Forced due to the fact that I simply had nothing to tell you. I pulled the rubber, got out of the RFP as best I could, hoping that the boss would appear and clarify our further actions.
But there is no boss, and the situation around us does not become softer and I no longer see the point in pulling the cat by the balls.

We have a difficult situation, too close attention to the company from the outside has led to the fact that the chief apparently decided to lay low.
There have been many leaks, there have been post-New Year's parties and many other circumstances that are tempting us to take a little vacation for all of us and wait until the situation settles down.

The reserve money, which was set aside for emergencies and urgent needs of the team, was not even enough to close the last salary payment. There is no boss, there is no clarity and certainty with further affairs, there is no money either.
We hope that the boss will appear and the company will continue to work, but for now, on behalf of the company, I apologize to all of you and ask you to be patient. All balances on the RFP will be paid, the only question is when.

Now I’ll ask you all to write to me in a personal: (ideally in a toad :))
- Actual backup contact for communication (it is desirable to register a fresh public toad
- Briefly your job responsibilities, projects, PL (for coders). Who did what, literally in a nutshell.

In the near future, we, with those team leaders who remained in the ranks, will think about how to restart all work processes, where to find money for salary payments and launch all our work projects with renewed vigor.
As soon as there is any news on payments, reorganization and return to work, I will contact everyone. In the meantime, I have to ask all of you to take a 2-3 month vacation.
We'll try to get back to work as soon as possible. From you - we ask everyone to take care of your personal safety! Clean up working systems, change accounts on forums, VPNs, if you need phones and PCs.
Your safety is your first responsibility! In front of yourself, in front of loved ones and in front of the team too!

I ask you not to break the PM with questions about the boss - I won’t tell anyone anything new, because I simply don’t know.
Once again I apologize Friends, I myself am not enthusiastic about all these events, we will try to somehow correct the situation.
Those who do not want to move on with us - we naturally understand. For those who will wait - we rest for 2-3 months, take care of our personal lives and enjoy freedom :)

All working rockets and internal frogs will soon be disabled, further communication - only on backup frogs. Peace for everyone!

But hardware compatibility with x86 is original there, in a bad way, although the average user should not worry about this.

Message: tomorrow Kyiv will be ours

Ukrainian media confirm that the Antonov airfield in Gostomel near Kiev has been captured. They also report that 10 IL-76 aircraft with Pskov paratroopers are flying there.

Russia , apparently, is building up its grouping surrounding Kiev. The Ukrainian media confirm that the Antonov airport in Gostomel remained under the control of our military, despite the attempts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to drive them out of there. At the same time, local publications report that ten IL-76 planes with Pskov paratroopers flew to the same airport.

If the assault on Kiev does not begin tonight, ten IL-76 aircraft, each of which can accommodate 225 paratroopers, can make such flights 3-4 times. It is easy to calculate that by morning, 15 km from the Ukrainian capital, there may be a 10,000-strong group of Russian troops, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine will have nothing to oppose.

Message: Russian troops reached the Dnieper, landed in Odessa and are advancing in the Kiev region
Chronicle of the operation to demilitarize Ukraine, 02/24/2022, DAY (updated)
Russian troops advanced 50-70 km deep into the territory of Ukraine in separate directions and occupy objects
Russian tanks in New Kakhovka
over the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station. It is reported that the Russian military is complacent, they allow you to shoot, they smile.
They also report that Russian motorized infantry was seen in Antonovka, which is three kilometers from Kherson on the right bank of the Dnieper, that is, it is already on the other side. A little later, a message came about the Russian flag over Kherson.
Russian landing from helicopters in the Kherson region
Let me also remind you that Russian troops were found deep on the territory of Ukraine in the Chernihiv region, in the vicinity of Kharkov and on the ring road of this city. The State Border Service of Ukraine reports the presence of Russian equipment in the Kiev region.. The SBU burns documents in the center of Kiev. Over Vishnev and Zhuliany (the trap of Kyiv), two Russian fighters flew over.
The mass of Russian helicopters over Gostomel, which is 5 km northwest of Kiev
The Black Sea port of Odessa under the control of the Russian marines.
On the road near Kharkov, a burnt armored personnel carrier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and a Russian "Tiger"
A strong explosion thundered in Kiev. It was heard in different parts of the capital. As adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs Gerashchenko clarifies, it was a missile attack by the Russian Armed Forces on military facilities in Brovary.
Sources close to the Office of the President of Ukraine report that all the starting positions of the Tochka-U operational-tactical missiles that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had, as well as all long-range missiles and air defense, were destroyed. All coordinates were known to Russia.
Ukrainian side is already claiming the 7th (!) downed Russian plane, despite the fact that all the "evidence" for the past six turned out to be rotten fakes from 1993 and 2011.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an emergency NATO summit.
Lukashenka said that he received Putin's assurances that he would consider the attack on Belarus as on the Russian Federation. The Border Committee of Belarus said that all Ukrainian checkpoints on the border with Ukraine were closed for an indefinite period. The Ministry of Defense of Belarus reported that a decision was made to close part of the airspace for flights of civil aircraft from 11.00 Kyiv time on February 24.
Zelensky submitted a bill on general mobilization to the Rada. For those who did not have time to leave Ukraine, this is not very good.

I don’t even bother myself with this, I solve more pressing tasks for myself - I go to interviews, I do test tasks.
I think that this is more productive than scrolling through news sites all day, reading who defeated and overthrew whom.
The whole country is now stuck in smartphones, every 5 minutes climbing to news sites for another dose of dopamine.
nice if they just stuck to the news, but there, under each news, they leave a bunch of dirt about "Khokhlov, quilted jackets, Muscovites."
I remember I once left a comment there with a call for peace, since both "Khokhols" and "Muscovites" were thrown with poop.
Peace to the people of Ukraine, peace to the people of Russia, may this whole bacchanalia end soon.

You can try out new directions for collecting botnets.
Distribute bots through whiteware: a site with broken software, torrents, etc.
bot is not reset and launched to the disk immediately, but for example when a certain menu item is selected (this can be done for sure, at least it worked for me on a notepad)
Such a distribution channel can work for years, because it works invisibly.

Message: Ideas for the topic of work and what to do next.
The only working topic now is ransom (maybe I'm wrong, I don't know).
ransomware , the first type is lockers (the most popular), the second type is collecting compromising evidence from Amer's computers and extracting money so that it is not published.
The first topic is well-worn, it is not safe, and a lot of unhealthy attention is riveted to it.
The second topic is not so well known. It is not as popular as lockers because it is more difficult than encrypting files and leaving a note on the desktop.
anything specific, I'm just suggesting discussing and thinking about it. Maybe there are some solutions and ideas, someone knows people who work this way, etc.

Message: Head of Rossotrudnichestvo Evgeny Primakov
In February 2003, a few weeks before the start of the American military operation in Iraq (yes, by the way, not approved by any UN Security Council, but who stopped it), Saddam Hussein distributed Kalash to the people.

In principle, there were plenty of weapons in all the houses, mostly the bosses. And with all the distrust of his own people (I remember how in pre-war Baghdad they canceled a pro-government demonstration and placed machine gunners on the roofs when they held a small parade of the Ministry of Internal Affairs), Saddam decided to arm literally everyone in the city. “Every window in our houses will turn into a firing point!” - propagated.

And when the Americans entered the city, it turned out that all these weapons were dismantled in order to fight off looters or, conversely, to engage in looting. And a little later, all these guns leaked underground, they are still fighting in Iraq and Syria.

In July 2011, a month before the fall of the capital, Muammar Gaddafi, fascinated by mass actions in support of him on Green Square in Tripoli, decided to arm the Libyans by handing out Kalash to them. Then the Americans (lead from behind) led a coalition that brought peace and democracy to Libya with bombs ( then the Security Council agreed to a no-fly zone, but it’s even more trouble the beginning - this did not limit regime change). Muammar Gaddafi believed that the armed people would defend the gains of the "green revolution". And when Tripoli fell in August , all these weapons were used either for looting, or in order to protect themselves from looting. And it still shoots.

When Zelensky decided to distribute 10,000 Kalash to the people of Kiev, I don’t want to compare him with Saddam or Gaddafi or compare us with the Americans – they had completely different reasons and logic: to attack other countries and start wars, but we just stop wars. I’m interested in something else: will 10,000 Kalashnikovs actually help Zelensky’s gop-company “defend Kiev” (no, they won’t) or, according to an established tradition, will they be used to settle old scores with neighbors and go to the nearest jewelry store?

I suspect that the gop company may well understand this. But they don’t care so much what will happen to Ukraine later, after they are sent to the denazification tribunal, that “burn the barn - burn the hut.”

Strength , patience, good luck and endurance to our guys who will have to rake it all up.

Everything becomes more interesting with the morning incident in Kiev, when for some reason the local air defense shot down a missile right above residential buildings. The rocket was mistakenly fired by Ukrainian forces at their own fighter jet, which allegedly crashed in another area on the outskirts of Kyiv, CNN found out.

An hour later, Ukrainian President Zelensky published an appeal in which he told citizens that the Russians were bombing Ukrainian cities. He called for a merciless fight against the invaders and destroy them.
