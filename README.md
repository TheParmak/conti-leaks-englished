~~Some strings are not properly translated by google so I will upload the original splitted pdfs too if you want to translate them with a better translator or with a better format.~~

~~If you have deepl pro access and want to help it would be great to translate them at deepl -which handles documents and some languages much better-. You can download the original pdfs, translate them, and create an issue uploading the translated pdfs so I can commit them to the repo.~~

Big thanks to @Nathannaelc for providing deepl translated pdf documents and json files.

Also big thanks to @offsecginger for providing json conversions of google translated pdf documents.
